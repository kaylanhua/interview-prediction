As you work on these features, how do you intend to measure the effectiveness of the smart phrase extraction, and what metrics or user feedback will you use to evaluate the dashboard's usefulness to the end-users?  

Interviewee: That's a very good question. So for dashboard what I did was I had in my complete if we had some we had a team for business intelligence. They used to work in on creating dashboards and Tableau as well as power bi so I had sit with them and ask them like if I give you just data of reviews, what do you want to see? I had talked with multiple people like what they want to see in a just in the reviews in kpis. Let's say I am developing a KP what they want to see what they wanted to know apart from it. I've been working for a client who was also working on reviews and I got some ideas over there. Like let's say showing them the how the product has evolved over here. So let's say we have a Samsung a series phone. So how the A52 a53 a 54 so how it has evolved over years. What do people are talking about it? When it was launched people were completely about camera. The next iteration people they didn't complain about cameras. They were complaining about something else or let's say, oh they had perfected the phone something like this. So they wanna show a line chart for this and then showing them top keywords to people are using so let's see people are using the word. battery a lot since it is a since it's a very good phone for have that has a amazing battery life of six or seven hours and people are talking about battery. I can just show them a chart or bar graph that showed that battery has a most expensive word similarly to English sentences. They told me something else like display or brightness. So brightens is very low for the phone. So people are talking Negatively about this brightness so we can have a bar chart that shows that brightness is on the top of negative words apart from the other. other complaints that people have and yeah, so that's it.",3,"Your plan to implement smart extraction of phrases and the idea of a dashboard with user-selectable keywords for sentiment analysis is quite innovative.

Interviewee: In web scraping, I have faced multiple challenges. I will describe each one in detail earlier first. We are used to scrape any very few sites like not to sites and scraping them is they are just static Pages like basic HTML if you load the website, you'll get the HTML you can just scrape it from there. But with the with the number of parties that are growing with the chatbot and the company we need to scrape multiple websites and each website comes in different formats. So I'm asked static websites some come as an infinite scroll upside and some commas like toggle ones like you have to use some feature like sidebar or something to scroll between the news articles. So yeah, what have done at this time was I used to study how these website is frame. Like what is the essential HTML structure that is followed and how is the class structure given to each component in the website and if there is any common class, how can you differentiate? Particular content I want from other ones which share this common class like using other properties or Keys available in the HTML tag and some kind of that. I had landed through debugging the site and doing some test runs and in finance clothing have done that with the puppeteer. Failure. We used access for simple scripting which doesn't work. Then we shifted to Puppeteer and when we shifted to Puppeteer when we automated this whole scraping and cleaning and everything process, we Face difficulties because of multi-threading what happened what used to happen was there used to be the scraper used to work on some websites. And if any website is loading slow, it used to exit after 30 seconds and it will not address it again. So then I resist about what are the other ways we can do then I got to know about Puppeteer clusters, which is essentially you open fights in a chrome instance and do balance scraping which increases the speed of scraping and also that also has a feature of sending back to the cube suppose if any site is a or any subside in a website, which we are supposed to scrape. He's a not loading fast. It could be due to network reason or it could be due to the server problem at the website holder itself What we have done was if any exception has happened during the scraping.

Interviewee: Right. So gcp is Google Cloud platform and that this platform gives us a lot of models in build on it. So we have these models like Mistral Mistral Moe mixture of experts and lot of other models which are already inbuilt deployed on this so that to make use of these models is pretty easy for us. There is all in a you know, in a overall project. There are a lot of things to you know handle like there is scaling models scaling when to you know, use a lot of gpus when to decrease the GPU. It depends on the number of people are there so that all these kinds of things are already taken care by the gcp so that we can we can try to focus on a lot of other important stuff the Technical Machine learning stuff. So gcp does all these things like we have these vertex AI which has these all inbuilt morals in on it and we try To use them and also on top of it I guess gcp is a partnered with BLM BLM is a library which hosts these model much more better. It has these techniques of fast attention, which can make the model more faster and it can it can improve the inference time. So using gcp what we did is we have these all model techniques and all these optimization all these you know, Load balancing techniques and all is already included in it. And on top of that in the gcp platform. We can also have these databases also we can map to our model. So there are different databases. We are using in Google one is a blob storage where we can store all the CSV PDFs and all in a pocket such that and there are a lot of other storages like we can have logs we can have all these logs if there is an issue. We log all those issues and Trace them whenever we need them. We are using the gcp platform to do these logs and we also also save all the model answers so that we can you know Trace back that day, you know, we have improved the model and and we can compare our previous Model results and our new model results and check if we are improving and there are a lot of other metrics also like observation tools which gcp builds us like observation like, you know the inference Time the you know the load time how many if there is a any downtime for these models and there are a lot of other metrics and observation tools which gcp has using all these things all together and gcp gives us one environment where all these three all these things can come together and gcp also provides these interfaces where we can do a development environment. We can do the testing and we can do the production environment so that If you don't, you know mess up the production we are doing all the development in the development environment. And whenever we have something new we can push it to the testing and that you know, we can do all the testing and the testing environment and when every test case is passes we can push it to the production environment and we can do this in a cicd pipeline where continuous continuous integration and continuous deployment. Is there once we pushed in our get gcp will understand. Hey, you are pushed it's going to go automatically go into the testing environment test it out and automatically fall as clear as it can, you know do all these production all these take things take a lot of time. But if we include gcp in inside the picture these things, you know easily we can equip this thing's much more faster and better and it also provides these kubernetes cluster it also have these Docker registry where we can you know, push all the Dockers.

So I have worked on a lot of things in gcp.",3,"The use of DPO to mitigate bias and the feedback mechanism for continuous learning are excellent strategies for ensuring fairness and user satisfaction. Leveraging user feedback to retrain the model is a key component of maintaining model performance and ethical standards. Additionally, using a set of predefined questions for a supervised metric like MCQs is a solid approach to evaluate the model's understanding of the domain. To further explore your technical skills, can you explain how you would use GCP (Google Cloud Platform) in conjunction with these models, particularly for training and deployment in a production environment?","Right. So gcp is Google Cloud platform and that this platform gives us a lot of models in build on it. So we have these models like Mistral Mistral Moe mixture of experts and lot of other models which are already inbuilt deployed on this so that to make use of these models is pretty easy for us. There is all in a you know, in a overall project. There are a lot of things to you know handle like there is scaling models scaling when to you know, use a lot of gpus when to decrease the GPU. It depends on the number of people are there so that all these kinds of things are already taken care by the gcp so that we can we can try to focus on a lot of other important stuff the Technical Machine learning stuff. So gcp does all these things like we have these vertex AI which has these all inbuilt morals in on it and we try To use them and also on top of it I guess gcp is a partnered with BLM BLM is a library which hosts these model much more better. It has these techniques of fast attention, which can make the model more faster and it can it can improve the inference time. So using gcp what we did is we have these all model techniques and all these optimization all these you know, Load balancing techniques and all is already included in it. And on top of that in the gcp platform. We can also have these databases also we can map to our model. So there are different databases. We are using in Google one is a blob storage where we can store all the CSV PDFs and all in a pocket such that and there are a lot of other storages like we can have logs we can have all these logs if there is an issue. We log all those issues and Trace them whenever we need them. We are using the gcp platform to do these logs and we also also save all the model answers so that we can you know Trace back that day, you know, we have improved the model and and we can compare our previous Model results and our new model results and check if we are improving and there are a lot of other metrics also like observation tools which gcp builds us like observation like, you know the inference Time the you know the load time how many if there is a any downtime for these models and there are a lot of other metrics and observation tools which gcp has using all these things all together and gcp gives us one environment where all these three all these things can come together and gcp also provides these interfaces where we can do a development environment.

I mean to say initially we got the data. I mean in image formats, so we called the Kokomo model with which is a good sense of model, which identifies what kind of object the image as So we tested for various images the Kokomo model gives where the object is present in particular image. I mean in the exact whether it is at the top left corner top right corner bottom right corner bottom left corner bottom center.

And for the final rail drop out is not needed because it generally like the weights and biases are already learned and the model is able to classify correctly which which we then passed to a softmax classifier directly without any trouble so that we get the correct classes.",2,"Given the effectiveness of dropout in preventing overfitting, how do you select the appropriate dropout rate for your layers?

Could you elaborate on the specific clustering algorithms you found most effective for FDC data, and how you validated the clusters to ensure they accurately represented normal and anomalous behavior?  

Interviewee: Okay, so that is a very interesting question. And actually that is what made the task the most challenging for us now initially. Well, now the thing is one of the challenges of using the time series data is if you try to like initially I would use the hierarchical clustering method to Cluster based on the time series data, but that would take up too much amount of time. And because the production is a very fast process so it became like necessary that we can do it efficiently and like in a very short period of time so that's why what I did is at first I will use the PCA the principal component analysis method to do the dimensionality reduction on the time series data and bring it down to a 2d space. And now that we have it in the 2D space then I will use the clustering method. So here initially I started with the came in clustering method, but the problem with the came in clustering is it is like a distance Place method. So all the Clusters that will be formed is will always be in a circle. but in this particular case when you project it to the lower Dimension does not always mean that that they should be in the circular form like all the Clusters so it became more important to to take into consideration the the density as well as like the distribution of each of the like points. And so as far as the distribution based clustering is concerned so I use the gaussian mixture model for the clustering and yeah, so and then like what I will do is like for example during the training period I will have the Clusters and then I will note down like which pattern will belong to which clusters like by that I mean that even though the clustering is done on the two-dimensional space, but the pattern will then be Taken for the time series data and to take the pattern from the time series data. I will use the Battery Center method. So like Barry Center is similar to the center, but Center is for the two-dimensional or the three-dimensional data, but the Battery Center will be the center of the time series data now, I will Store The Battery Center in a library kind of thing. And that is the training part. And now then I will again do the clustering on the Testing period of the monitoring period and now I will try to see now after the Clusters has been done and the patterns are have been generated based on the time series data. I will try to check with the library like whether this patterns are already present inside the library or they are the new patterns now if they are already present inside the library and like because we already know that all the patterns inside the library is supposed to be from the budo if it's because no alarm was raised. So in that way we will try to like there were two ways either inside the Library if there is some pattern and the user have already informed us that this pattern is a bad pattern and if we get the same pattern in the monitoring period then we can directly say that these are bad patterns, but if a new pattern will come up which is not there inside our library and we don't know anything about it then all so we will try to inform the user about the new Pattern from the clustering that came up and like that will be kind of a Softail on to the user and they will check and verify and will fit back to us whether that pattern is a actual bad pattern or not. But because like clustering is a unsupervised method. So the important task here is to detect new patterns, and and we did that quite successful.

And so as far as the distribution based clustering is concerned so I use the gaussian mixture model for the clustering and yeah, so and then like what I will do is like for example during the training period I will have the Clusters and then I will note down like which pattern will belong to which clusters like by that I mean that even though the clustering is done on the two-dimensional space, but the pattern will then be Taken for the time series data and to take the pattern from the time series data. I will use the Battery Center method. So like Barry Center is similar to the center, but Center is for the two-dimensional or the three-dimensional data, but the Battery Center will be the center of the time series data now, I will Store The Battery Center in a library kind of thing. And that is the training part. And now then I will again do the clustering on the Testing period of the monitoring period and now I will try to see now after the Clusters has been done and the patterns are have been generated based on the time series data. I will try to check with the library like whether this patterns are already present inside the library or they are the new patterns now if they are already present inside the library and like because we already know that all the patterns inside the library is supposed to be from the budo if it's because no alarm was raised. So in that way we will try to like there were two ways either inside the Library if there is some pattern and the user have already informed us that this pattern is a bad pattern and if we get the same pattern in the monitoring period then we can directly say that these are bad patterns, but if a new pattern will come up which is not there inside our library and we don't know anything about it then all so we will try to inform the user about the new Pattern from the clustering that came up and like that will be kind of a Softail on to the user and they will check and verify and will fit back to us whether that pattern is a actual bad pattern or not. But because like clustering is a unsupervised method. So the important task here is to detect new patterns, and and we did that quite successful. Yeah.",3,True

Interviewee: short transfer learning is a very common process not just when LP but also for A computer vision as well, but transfer learning has gained its popularity in llms right now. So the point of transfer learning is when you have a particular deep learning model you train it on lots of data set the right. For example, let's take the ULM fit paper, which I know very summary because briefly because that was very pivotal. So this particular paper just took a large language model to some extent Transformers and training it on Wikipedia, right? So I just change the prediction next for prediction and sometimes even fill in the blacks prediction, right? So the idea is just to train the model on a large Corpus of data set. What this does is it generalize a model on a data set and for NLP Publishers, at least make sure that the model. Knows a lot of things about the language like English. It was a few string together sentences. And so give them this when you take this particular model and then you find your network to a particular task you bringing the experience in the weights of the model from previous huge task and then making sure it's focused on us.

Say maybe a sentiment prediction very simple. This is subset of this because that's a entire language model that's predicting next to it. But this one. It just uses a few sentences and so on. To protect what the sentiment is now where this previous knowledge. It becomes very easy and the training converges very easy simpler in this particular product.

Can you walk me through the specific techniques or models you've found most effective in this context, and why you chose them over others?  

Interviewee: Okay. So in our large monolith service, one of the entry point was language detection and another entry point was language translation. And of course they were both related to each other depending upon the language that we are detecting we would have to compile it into English language because some of our models that were used for other business activities. They were only trained on English language. So that was the use case of both the language detection and translation. Services and regarding the optimization. But so when I saw the initial code that was in Python, so the operation was worked. So the operation part was done in two phases. First was the code part or you could say the development part and the second one was. The machine learning part so first I'll describe the code part in the core Part. I noticed that in our development phases or whatever. They used in the development the code the python code written was not clean and there were some rules which were employed for detecting language and they had CLD the name of the library. I'm quoting here citing here. They were using CLD. So basically they were using Bayesian methods for language what the library that they were using they based on Bayesian methods and it was slow and it was slow for Asian languages and it was inaccurate for Forex Auto sentences that were very small in size. And in our case there were chants that we would get a lot of data that would be good as a small sentences. so yeah, that's the like that's how I went about with the language detection part regarding the models as I told initial initial. I would I wouldn't say model but the way they were using the libraries it used. Live base. And after that what I told was either we can go with the the word level embeddings or sentence level embeddings and we can use the classification over that so I tested couple of word embeddings. Like for example, what do I can fast text and then I also evaluated couple of bird base architecture where we would be using Anna classification layer to classify the language that is off. But the problem here is of course that we don't want our language detection model to be very big, right? So the fastest that was language now on to the language translation part initially, they had a GPU based models andand easy So yeah, that's about it regarding these two.",3,"Great!

It will kind of give you it'll kind of build you another server for that and it can load balance all the traffic according to it. Will it will distribute all its traffic to do those different servers according to this load balancing. Definitely it gives you a different charts for how much more the service you are using but that is the best hand like about it AWS is that it really helps you scale as you go like it really?

Interviewee: Sure. So I was tasked to deploy and design a model training API, which is hosted on AWS ec2 platform. So the model training API was hosted using Python and flask. So flask gives us an API invariant. The customer can issue a model training command API and internally the model will fits.

And we have also used Wallace filter to make sure the contrast is in. And, oh, yeah. One more thing. So when we do fly or drawn itself, we need something named as, GSD. So GSD is the distance, global sampling distance. So what it means is that, how much meters a single pixel represents. So we have normalized that GSD also so that, model find its e find it easier to map those pixels, and there is not too much of a a difference among the autos even though the capturing process capturing of image process was different or something, you could say, and not the at the same GST.

Which is which is different from a regular neural network is the convolution itself. So basically you have filters of different sizes and you convert these filters with your image and then you suppose you have 20 cross 20 Mage and you have some other filter and after converting you get suppose a five cross five image. So what basically this convolution does is it reduces the amount of complexity of your image, but it still has the data in it because of the convolution you are not just ignoring the cells.

282,282,282,282,"Interviewer: Thank you for sharing those experiences. It's clear that you've tackled complex problems across a range of domains. Given your extensive work in computer vision, can you discuss a specific instance where you had to optimize a model for better performance, perhaps in terms of speed or accuracy, and what strategies you employed to achieve that?  

Interviewee: Okay. Okay. So in that particular scenario, so we'll take about the sizzle project in which I have applied computer vision. So there was a challenge like okay if someone is shooting someone and there is a gun and in that particular those games, so we annotate those frames. So there were annotators who were annotating. I was involved in moreover the model development and Improvement of due to the hyper parameters and other things so the framework was a tensorflow and the model we were using was resonate 18 reset 50. We tried with different model Inception version 3. Also we have tried that time so majorly the model was revolving around resnet 18 doesn't 50 and Inception version 3. So in that particular scenario, there was a challenge like there are multiple there are not multiple frames of one single in instance because the inside instance of shooting someone suppose. I'm taking just an example suppose if someone is shooting someone in that particular scenario, there will be not multiple frames you will get to annotate so in that particular, If there is a scenario that if you don't have data if much data to train a model that I in that particular scenario, I have applied the argumentation techniques documentation technique was a little bit constrained. So we have applied like in the contract rightness rotation zooming and other prospective to give an idea. Okay, this particular instance will look something like this and this particular instance will look something like this. So I applied different documentation technique. And there is a Dropout layer as well in that that particular training model in which diffuses which basically multiple neurons to learn from each other so that the model should not be biased towards any of the particular class. Basically if you can say because in object or that is a classification plus detection, right? So so that should not be biased so I I have cartoons some of the hyper parameters as well like those hyper parameter first. I applied some argumentation techniques which improve my accuracy from originally the accuracy was like 72 to 72% when I have applied documentation techniques logically, like different different scenarios. There are in build argumentation technique. So in Python and tensorflow now Keras is also part of tensorflow. So in that particular scenario, I have applied documentation technique then a regularization technique in which Dropout layer was a scenario where I have used a Dropout layer. and in the final stage at the time of detection, right? So for optimizing that thing I have also like change some of the hyper parameters inside the tensorflow model which gave me an accuracy of around like 189 to 90% of accuracy and they were some few other things like adding some of the more images for that particular instance. Our accuracy at that particular season was 97.98 % accurate of a model was because we were Add argument and we are keeping our and making our data set very stronger over the times like slowly slowly over the time. We have multiple data set and from those data sets if the data set has been improved and because we are focusing again three to four games right there were not much of the incense is to be stored at our basically annotators. So from the increasing the data set also it helped me a lot and from the hyper parameter tuning like in Yolo. There is a have a parameter tuning to for the bounding boxes, which is generated as cross as right in the how you know works is like as process we divide the basically frames and the bounding box center point if the object lies in that in that particular scenario that bounding box is responsible to basically detect that particular object from from the image. So that particular thing also I have applied so hyper parameter tuning regularization technique like argumentation and Dropout layer help me to achieve almost like 95 to 97% of accuracy in season which was a good accuracy and over the time we we can figure out to increase more as well. But yeah, this was the whole particular thing, which I have done in any of this was the same thing, but there was bunch of 100 returns more annotators as comparison to season 2, we have much of the data and obviously the brand logos and other things should not will not change over the time like it will not change drastically right like suddenly.Over instances are very easy to pick up and why because as comparison to gaming because in gaming sometimes it happens like the instance will be a little bit changed and there will be a challenge if something is like little bit more change than it will be a challenge. But in in terms of logo detection it is not that much difficult and we calculate the pose estimation as well. And we tell in nanometer. We also tell the clients that okay, you can place your logo from here to here so that your brand visibility will be increasing because if you think in when a batsman is playing right in that particular position it he is in a like bend down position in which this particular logo will not be that much visible if it is in the chest and if it is it will be in the stomach then it will be more visible when a batsman is playing and if some player is playing at that particular point which particular section of the boundary in I'm taking up example of cricket in which particular section like situation is always hitting in this particular. Direction so what will happen is like for the other and that was a real-time detection in which God we suggested is true like at the end in the fencing there are brandings. Right? So if Rohit Sharma is having this this particular flow of playing in this particular direction, so we suggest Brands.

Interviewee: Yeah, great question. So let's talk about one fine tuning technique, which I am working currently. So there are a lot of different techniques which I did I can cover all of them if you if you are interested, but let's cover one technique which I did which is pretty you know unique in its own way and not people not usually people do that.

Let's say there are a lot of medicines named Frozen and all so if a chatbot gives all these medication names it can be dangerous and it can so what what should the chatbots says if anyone asked these medical questions the chatbot should say that hey I can advise you, you know, what is the symptoms and conditions, but I cannot, you know advice. Any prescription prescription medicine you have to consult a doctor or some expert for this? So that's why this is the card rail, which we are trying to build in this chatbot. So we find tuned our model to learn this kind of question that if anyone asks, you know about these medicines and all our guardrail is going to get triggered such that it doesn't give the answer and it also gives the right advice to go to you know, the respected. Experts of this field who can give the right advice to the customer to the patient because a doctor can ask hundreds of questions. It understands the history of the of the patient and accordingly all these kind of criteria. It gives a prescribed medicine and we want the best for our patient. That's why we build this card and how did we build this guardrail is we use DP or technique? That's a direct difference optimization technique. How did we build the data set is for building this data sets. We need a question. We need to choose an answer. We need a rejected answer. So the loss function of this DPO is as such that we try to find the model such that the question and the chosen answer. The chosen answer has, you know, we try to increase the chosen answers preference increase the probability of that and decrease the rejected answers probability such that, you know, every time in the user Answer is always set by the this model.

What we can do is we can have lot of physical physics related Wikipedia articles or any articles research papers and all and we can feed it to our pre-trained model such that it can do the next word prediction and it can learn this domain of physics. That's how this is done and coming to the instructor fine tuning technique it that's where you know where the moral can learn to follow an instruction. Not only it understands the physics domain. So, you know understanding some Concepts and domain is one part and the second part is to also the chatbot has to follow the instructions given by the user. That's where instruct fine-tuning comes the data set over there. It looks like where we give the instruction we have a question and we also have an answer in this pattern. It will understand that.

And this is how we try to you know, use a free trained model to find tune on top of a clinical data set domain. So and this is one thing let's talk about general, you know, fine tuning of General fine tuning is one instructing and another is you know continuation for fine tuning. So what is continuation and fine tuning in let's say our free training model is not expert in physics. What we can do is we can have lot of physical physics related Wikipedia articles or any articles research papers and all and we can feed it to our pre-trained model such that it can do the next word prediction and it can learn this domain of physics. That's how this is done and coming to the instructor fine tuning technique it that's where you know where the moral can learn to follow an instruction. Not only it understands the physics domain. So, you know understanding some Concepts and domain is one part and the second part is to also the chatbot has to follow the instructions given by the user. That's where instruct fine-tuning comes the data set over there. It looks like where we give the instruction we have a question and we also have an answer in this pattern. It will understand that. Hey there's a instruction and we have to follow that instruction. That's how you know the pre-training date. This is the data set for the instruction fine tuning works.",3,True

So it's super Volta only I worked in a project called Nova. So in that project what we what we do is that we take the floor plan image from a user and from taking the Fortran image from a user we try to do a performer multi-level segmentation multiplayer segmentation. So that gives us the different rooms. I mean, which one is the living room? Which one is a dining room? Which one is the balcony which is a wall. So all these classes we try to extract but performing a segmentation. I mean, we have modified the cubic we have referred to the previous set of modifications to come up with this modern then what we did. Is there after getting all the different classes then we have used the opening a pipelines. I mean by plans to make some predictions to give some recommendations to the user based on the layout of the room and also place the products with some strategy in the room. So the product placement as well as the recommendation of the new newer product based on the products that are already in the room as well as the orientation of the room the space available on this thing. So this is one of the things we did when we integrated both natural numbers processing and competition and I think it is one of the main one of the most important thing because you cannot expect a single project line only one single domain integrating different from And domains and then coming up with a particular use case. That is very that could be very strong for our organization. So always helpful.",3,True

Interviewee: Thank you, very good. So my second experiment involved something called Mirror Vic. So that was a fine tuning technique, which is closely related to language modeling which forces the model to identify deeper meanings of words. Okay. So what we do is we you know, We actually Target a single word in a sentence to learn the deeper, meaning of then mask some random other words in the same sentence and then, you know try to get a word in context representation of the word or a word in context embedding of the word. So the embedding of the word but in that context, right so this concept I extended it to idioms. So I I replace idioms with a single, you know new token that I personally created. So because that's a research that shows that idioms are treated independently other than you know pieces, you know, idioms are handled as independent tokens rather than you know, aggregate of other words, right? That is how Transformers usually try to learn ads and that is how humans actually understand.

Okay, so if the idiom is used in if the idiomatic phase potentially idiomatic phrase is used in a non-literal sense, then the embedding of it would be very different than when the idiom is used in a literal sense. Right? So we find it for language modeling using contrastive learning described in the middle and we found that it really really helps in.

We deployed we installed that deep stream application first and we deployed our model into that so that we could get a better frame rate. So in your low V5, we find tuned the model according to our rescaling size of images.

What I asked for was that get me on instance of redis. What I'll do is I'll cash some of the model hashes and the topic hashes and I will then collect some of the data. Into redis. So let's say whatever consumers we are putting for the Kafka whenever it is being pulled. We will also.

Interviewee: Short so my first starts for this for the creation of platform like ours asked to make a whole system that was plug-and-play that if you had any new feature or Services coming to it for the data collection platform if there was any new service, for example, I have got this platform which stores all over the data in it. And now I have some client that wants to make use of the data. For example, it wants to know what is the average salary of these people. There's another client who wants to make who have got their data. They want to kind of have their own service that they don't want to use or use out of that. So I had to make sure it should be it should be a very plug-in play friendly platform and to ensure that I went through different architectures of how you design stuff and the most beneficial and efficient approach that I could see was definitely the microservice architecture where I had the main server the main server looked after the database and had created a few Apex calls that I could, you know publicly tell like if you Want the data from this you can actually give a hit to my my main server and will give you the requested data for that. So I have got the main server that is looking after the database. Then I had know if definitely to have it tested. I had to present them with a few Services of my own. The first service was that I'm kind of taking the data and uploading it for the Google Google Sheets. So I had a different server that was his name different server, which was calling out to the first server of the database. And it would make a pact also get into the two fetch data like the the means our facility data of what we call from the database and it would kind of recall that call. That means API call would be made by another server. So it's like the main server has got all the list of points. Okay, you can let me do this. You can let me do this. You can let me do this and you can it will handle you the names of API now you can create your own service and anything that that's required. Anything that's required to you know enable anything that's required to kind of. Make sure whatever task you want to do of just like calling out the data from the main server. It's I just go again.

These are my apis you can use them and we can like make use out of the data that you want us to collect in the first place. So now me as a service. I have my server and own the plug and play fashion comes into the place that all I need is the aps. I ping the I hit the API and get the data and use it for my own purpose. Now, for example, there's another service that I would like to do that would kind of need me to you know, just let's say to do a data check.

This involves evaluating various models based on their like, you know. What was the complexity number of parameters and inference time? We prioritize models. That offer competitive performance on the task at hand. Then quantifying the source requirements. We quantify the competition resources required for training in France and deployment of each model.

We just make the code with the logic and create an ECR Docker image out of it. So for the crossing as well as the training job, so what we will do is whenever we see there is any issue like drift happened basically, like if there is any features drift happen, we use like statistical test like kale Divergence test. So this helps us to find the drift which happened in each of the feature. So if the number of features were high, Drift happened so we can say there is a data trip happened. Similarly. There is a more we try to find the metric often East Batcher and the metric is been declining for some particular batches. We can say like a model drift has happened. So if anyone of the drift happened what will lose you'll try to trigger this continuous training pipeline where already we have our courts ready, right Crossing job and training job.

We'll just again do this validation on some of the new production data, which is not used for the training and we just check the production model as well as the newly trained model and will decide based on the metric.

Given your experience with fine-tuning models for audio data, what specific challenges did you encounter with the pre-existing architecture during the fine-tuning process, and how did you address these challenges to ensure the model's effectiveness in classifying cat and dog sounds accurately?","Primarily when we started the project. We don't know anything about the architecture and we used to do different kinds of experimentation. So as the pre-existing architecture takes human sounds and classify the emotion in them.

Interviewee: So the the part where the part where I applied caching was during my internship at AMD. So in AMD, we do a lot of sensitivity studies, which also include sensitivity to caches and how different sizes of caches impact my performance. My deeper level of understanding of caches was used when we, when there was a particular instance where my workload was showing very negligible sensitivity to cash. To, LC level of cash specifically.

Interviewee: Yeah, so, you know populating data set while using traditional algorithms involved feature engineering where you know, we can derive more data from the already existing data and we can make more features on the same. For example, even label encoding books with the same. And you know, I have worked with the project in my past experience. I have worked with a project. It was a fun project. It was Titanic survival prediction. So I just did it to have a fun time with my friends and what I in the data set what I got was there was many unrelated features.

I started basically work on Matlab and in which I have done video compression algorithm with the help of these this particular algorithm, which we have research. I took participate on Smart India hackathon and smart India hackathon. I we are the we went first and we developed a tool for a Ministry of Sciences. So we have done after that two internships and those two in townships was based on basically the object reduction and one was based on the C plus plus two basically stabilized the movie videos and after that I done one internship in which I have done objectives using tensorflow. So that is one of the project after that. I have done multiple projects like face detection. I have done and one of the project which I started in manual was basically a sports company earlier and they have a data science team over there. And what we do is like we take the video frames from the nanotechnology video frames of the sports events like FIFA Cricket orphan race. So we have the video frames we extract those video frames using open CV and from that those frames we have some bunch of annotated. Over there we created a data Lake for the different brands like Coca-Cola Pepsi and other brands which is present at the time of sports event. So we did for pkl Chennai. Sorry IPL for Chennai Super King specifically those that was our client F1 race that particular is our also client. So we calculate the return of investment using object detection techniques. So we used YOLO technique and we you use your flow. We use Cafe and Cafe to at that time because it was from 2017 to 2919 where I worked in nanotech. So basically the idea was to calculate the brand visibility using of the direction technique after that. I moved to seasonal Bangalore there was doing so that company was based out of an online gaming company and that was an early stage of startup which I have done like only four to four or five members were there. So my role over there was a computer vision technique in which so I applied objection technique in like four to five. Games, so the main target was to extract the video frame from the twitch stream. So which is a platform where online Gamers usually play games and where we have all the like we targeted 4 to 5 Games over there. So there are different moments like someone is killing. Someone is poking someone so those particular frames we have again a bunch of annotators with us and we focus on three to four games with different events. So they are basically measure something like this. The help of sound engineer sound basically as well from at the back end there was a sound as well. So with the help of sound like gun firing shot is there so that sound will also help us and the objection technique.

Interviewee: Are multiple projects in which I have applied the time series application. So one of them is for example for the anomaly detection is the in the oea status OES is a special kind of the data in the semiconductor. That is the optical emission spectroscope data where the we get the web length and now we had to and now we know that the semiconductor manufacturing is a fast process as well as a as well as a complicated one. So that's why we have this thing known as the inline detection. So in line detection means that the anomaly will be detected as and when the semiconductor is is produced like there are multiple ways one is the offline offline will mean that once everything has already been done. Then you try to analyze and diagnose if any of the Wafers at some problem but in line will mean that as and when the wafer is inside the chamber and everything is going on you try to detect that now to do that. What I do is I I created this anomaly detection algorithm using the arima method now, I simply started with the arima because like I could not move to A complicated a very like the robust model because of the insufficiency of the data because the data is also limited while working in the semiconductor like you need to filter all kind of things and then get a very small data set and that's why I use the arima and using the arima what I used is based on all the previous Wafers. I tried to forecast the values for the like the next waveform and when the next wave will go in then that will produce a actual value and then I will try to calculate the difference between these two and when I calculate the difference between this two I try to see that how different is the actual from the real one and I will try to take the three sigma difference because if the predicted value and the actual value is three Sigma different from each other then that will mean that there is probably some anomaly. Otherwise if it is within the three sigma range, then we will consider it as a normal way for and we will just move on because we need to make sure that we like other than detecting the anomaly. We also had to make sure that we don't raise too many false alarm because that will create a hindrance in the production. And the other thing that I did with the time series data is the time series clustering that I will use in the in the Conductor there is a special kind of another special kind of the data which is known as the FDC data and FDC is the sensor data present in like the sensor data, which is collected as and when the wafer goes in so for each of the wafer or all the different sensors that are inside inside the chamber will be activated and they will record some kind of values the values may be the pressure temperature or some kind of the thing. And now what I will do is when I have to complete data for the whole way for I will try to Cluster them and For and using clustering like whenever there is some animal away for or something like that. Then it will be then it's Behavior will be different from what I already have Insight like from the from the previous way for inside the library and and I will try to like see that how is the anomalous way for is different from the all the correct way for us? Yeah.",4,"Understood, you've tailored your solution to the specific constraints of semiconductor design, which is crucial for accuracy. Leveraging GPU for the final product is a smart move for performance. Shifting focus a bit, I noticed you've also worked with time series analysis. Can you discuss how you've applied your machine learning expertise to time series data, perhaps in the context of anomaly detection or any other relevant application?","Are multiple projects in which I have applied the time series application. So one of them is for example for the anomaly detection is the in the oea status OES is a special kind of the data in the semiconductor. That is the optical emission spectroscope data where the we get the web length and now we had to and now we know that the semiconductor manufacturing is a fast process as well as a as well as a complicated one. So that's why we have this thing known as the inline detection. So in line detection means that the anomaly will be detected as and when the semiconductor is is produced like there are multiple ways one is the offline offline will mean that once everything has already been done.

607,607,607,607,"Interviewer: Certainly! In Python, the ""yield"" keyword is used in the context of defining a generator function. When you use ""yield"" in a function instead of ""return"", it transforms the function into a generator. The key difference is that ""return"" terminates a function and sends a specified value back to its caller, while ""yield"" pauses the function, saves its state, and then continues from where it left off the next time it's called. This ability to pause and resume execution is what makes generators memory efficient, as they don't need to store all their values in memory at once. Instead, they generate values on the fly, which can significantly reduce memory usage, especially with large datasets or computations. Given this explanation, how might you now consider using the ""yield"" keyword in your Python projects, particularly in the context of AI and ML where memory efficiency is a concern?

What I had planned is that I will use the database one that has the actual reviews using that I will train the model or fine tune it and then just calculate the sentiment of those specific reviews and put it in a second data frame. I will read from it or database a right turn on database B. Now what happens is that let's have been we got a reviews 1000 reviews and on day one we had trained with let's say a million reviews on Day Zero and we had permission database now, we got 1000 more reviews. Now, what do we do is that we will use the time stamp to Cache those 1000 reviews and then Process do our preprocessing and calculating the sentiment and all those stuffs and then we will just try those thousand reviews into the second database. Now. What happens is that in the midnight? We will restart the server. So that it could refresh all the reviews that we had. So the next database on day one midnight on DayZ on Devon midnight will have one million 1000 records while the original database will have they will have it set up. They didn't realize",2,True

Interviewee: Exactly. So first of all, we have to do data augmentation to do to solve the problem of class imbalance. Then we have employed various strategies new strategies in which we have used couple of what we can say extracting new features from the images which have prohibited items. So our main task would be to first of all find the images which have prohibited items in them. And then we will try to focus more upon them. So we will be using attention mechanism to do this and to remove the background tribe tribals, then let's imagine we have 100 images. What we will do is we will pay each and every image with each other so they will be 100 C2 combinations of these images and will try to what we can say find out the features from each of them so that they will focus upon the similarities and dissimilarities between the images which have the prohibited items.

So first of all, we have to do data augmentation to do to solve the problem of class imbalance. Then we have employed various strategies new strategies in which we have used couple of what we can say extracting new features from the images which have prohibited items. So our main task would be to first of all find the images which have prohibited items in them. And then we will try to focus more upon them. So we will be using attention mechanism to do this and to remove the background tribe tribals, then let's imagine we have 100 images. What we will do is we will pay each and every image with each other so they will be 100 C2 combinations of these images and will try to what we can say find out the features from each of them so that they will focus upon the similarities and dissimilarities between the images which have the prohibited items.

Interviewee: Shirt, so in this particular project the entire aim was to make sure that we do pseudocode to Coeur translation. to a good extent in the similar to the performance of llms, but without the computational cost of lnms so we ended up taking a very Low level approach we did not use any large language models. The views are decision tree and we used a simple lstm for Generation. So this just kind of three different phases first is the this one copy phase in this week copy all the tokens from the solo code which can be directly put in the code. For example, you have you know, sort of code you have let's say set variable X to 3. So X is something that can be directly copied. So we make sure that we Mark that as you know, this is something that can be copied. and then we use lstm to generate the code version of the suit of court, but with masks where we can take the copy tokens that we have generated. Later on the combined phase is where we take this. sentence that our lstm generated with masked tokens and we combine them with our Copy tokens, which have been generated by the decision tree.

So what we figured out was the most problem was when the lstm which was having issues with translating the court to one from Sudoku to court and the copy Facebook was doing pretty great.

We tried it on this is well, so it's a little bit more generalized. we increase the Window and we tried by STM. We tried a few different things.

I've been working recently with my department friends from various different streams. Like UI ux the project name is Nutri suggest this Nutri suggest is basically a project which is based on providing the users the correct diet plan the correct tailored diet plan for them related to their health condition. Let's say in India or in apart across the world and many people are facing many health conditions. Let's say hi obesity higher or let's say BP sugar and kind of many like pcod kind of health conditions where actually died plays a very important role in them apart from medications medication can only restrict and you know, can I only little or little effect it can create on? In longer and prevention of the health condition and the main routes of the health condition license what you intake so intake is very necessary is one of my friend in your ux has been facing such problem so we could sit into together and discussing. about how will an ml project a machine learning project which could recognize patterns of health conditions use their input user provides and able to actually filter the search and provide them with the correct diet plan where actually the user can See what died to follow what of plan what plan of action to follow what day to take it what time this is all this ambiguity in the diet plans. If you search it on Google it is not reliable like one the different opinions on how what diet plan to follow but we have tailored the diet plan into such a way by the way from taking the diets from various different articles approaching real life dietitians. We have integrated the real life dietitians into the application where they can interview user can interact with the dedication directly call them. So Nutrisystem such an application where user gives his personal information trusting the application because the application is not just a doctor but a friend whose together with you until you make your ailment into an aide. So this is where like we have been participating in many hackathons with the same project and we've been seeing fruits like their ideas been like many people because this is a real time situation. Everybody's almost facing current so It can be able to supplication using. As a backend we have used python for the machine learning. So and we have used for frontend. Part so with HTML CSS bootstrap and react JS is done with one of my one of my friend and Android development has been under progress. We use. This is a web application, but we wanted to do we want to make it a mobile application also. So what we have me personally in the last semester, I've been working in the front end part. I've been building the interface the UI and the application my friend from UI ux team. We are actually a team of three. So my friend of your extreme was working on the figma about creating how the user experience is it so they have a very good can chat. We have a very good flowchart. We have real-time service with the user how they feel about the application. So we've been working on making this idea patent. Also by the university has been like guiding us to make this idea into a patent. and we've been like the challenges we face in this project was to actually this is an huge domain where they can they can be many adults to this project. They can be many additional input. So we are always open to input their always open to make changes. So we're actually Trying to build an application where it gives the best kind of plan of action to the user which user can follow and which is not also which is also budget friendly. I cannot give you a very expensive diet which you cannot afford so it should be a neutral one and it should be very effective to the user. So this is a project we've been working on like and talking about Services. We've been used AWS. Also this pro-life project where I've been deploying it in AWS has really helped me learn about cloud services have been doing a training in Java back on development and also AWS training currently. I'm like preparing for the AWS associate. Architect certificate also so it has been helping me to actually learn how the real time cloud services who work like S3 ec2 about the cloudfront about the global accelerator about how the kubernetes service the eks works with the fire Firebase. So how they elastic file system or the EBS are let's say any kind of security things like AWS Mackey, which actually works on machine learning patterns to give provide us and stiffly protect sensitive information.talking about the project backend back in is actually integrated with the reacts with the back end where we are using spring boot, so It is like it is well integrated project but it is full-fledged. It is not completely full fledged because we've been working on different different parts and we are small team.

In longer and prevention of the health condition and the main routes of the health condition license what you intake so intake is very necessary is one of my friend in your ux has been facing such problem so we could sit into together and discussing. about how will an ml project a machine learning project which could recognize patterns of health conditions use their input user provides and able to actually filter the search and provide them with the correct diet plan where actually the user can See what died to follow what of plan what plan of action to follow what day to take it what time this is all this ambiguity in the diet plans. If you search it on Google it is not reliable like one the different opinions on how what diet plan to follow but we have tailored the diet plan into such a way by the way from taking the diets from various different articles approaching real life dietitians. We have integrated the real life dietitians into the application where they can interview user can interact with the dedication directly call them. So Nutrisystem such an application where user gives his personal information trusting the application because the application is not just a doctor but a friend whose together with you until you make your ailment into an aide. So this is where like we have been participating in many hackathons with the same project and we've been seeing fruits like their ideas been like many people because this is a real time situation. Everybody's almost facing current so It can be able to supplication using. As a backend we have used python for the machine learning. So and we have used for frontend. Part so with HTML CSS bootstrap and react JS is done with one of my one of my friend and Android development has been under progress. We use. This is a web application, but we wanted to do we want to make it a mobile application also. So what we have me personally in the last semester, I've been working in the front end part. I've been building the interface the UI and the application my friend from UI ux team. We are actually a team of three. So my friend of your extreme was working on the figma about creating how the user experience is it so they have a very good can chat. We have a very good flowchart. We have real-time service with the user how they feel about the application. So we've been working on making this idea patent. Also by the university has been like guiding us to make this idea into a patent. and we've been like the challenges we face in this project was to actually this is an huge domain where they can they can be many adults to this project. They can be many additional input. So we are always open to input their always open to make changes. So we're actually Trying to build an application where it gives the best kind of plan of action to the user which user can follow and which is not also which is also budget friendly. I cannot give you a very expensive diet which you cannot afford so it should be a neutral one and it should be very effective to the user. So this is a project we've been working on like and talking about Services. We've been used AWS. Also this pro-life project where I've been deploying it in AWS has really helped me learn about cloud services have been doing a training in Java back on development and also AWS training currently. I'm like preparing for the AWS associate. Architect certificate also so it has been helping me to actually learn how the real time cloud services who work like S3 ec2 about the cloudfront about the global accelerator about how the kubernetes service the eks works with the fire Firebase. So how they elastic file system or the EBS are let's say any kind of security things like AWS Mackey, which actually works on machine learning patterns to give provide us and stiffly protect sensitive information.talking about the project backend back in is actually integrated with the reacts with the back end where we are using spring boot, so It is like it is well integrated project but it is full-fledged. It is not completely full fledged because we've been working on different different parts and we are small team. So they're actually making progress each day and make actually able to just don't expect you to deploy it will prepared. So the Prototype is actually ready.",3,True

Since you mentioned your work with NLP Transformer models, can you tell me about the research project you did on understanding idioms in these models? What were the key challenges and findings from that project? 

Interviewee: Yeah, great question. So the project that I was doing was a research project solely based on, you know understanding how and to what extent Transformers, you know process idioms. So idioms Have non-literal meanings. So for example, if somebody says kick the bucket the meaning of the idiom translates to somebody dying rather than somebody literally clicking a bucket so things like that are very context-based and as we know transform our specialty some, you know, initial Farmers like bird, they are they might not be very good at recognizing the hidden meaning of the words. So I read a good amount of research papers on what people did and stuff like that. So I am employed. I actually perform two experiments as part of a project. The first was seeing whether the Transformers understand idioms as part of a language or as a no Downstream tasks, right? So to this extent we employed something called adapters. So adapters are, you know Common these days but back then it was something really new. So we used a framework called Maddox, so it was made by even Village from Cambridge. So we provide language adapters and tasks adapters towards learning whether the idiom the potentially idiomatic phrase in the sentence was used in a literal sense or idiomatic sense. So the data set was a binary data set. And the Transformer was, you know trained and evaluated to predict whether the potentially idiomatic phrase was used in literal sense or you know idiomatic sense. So this data set of multilingual Portuguese plus English. So to understand how Transformers, you know, understand this. So I trained the, you know Transformer to identify idiomatic meaning in English then evaluated it on Portuguese and the same way. I trained it on Portuguese and evaluated evaluated it on English, so if the Transformer learns how to recognize idioms as a downstream task the transfer across languages would be high.Um considering we have language adapters just for understanding the language. So the only task essentially is to understand how to or what to do to identify the idioms, right? So, so I give me one minute. Sorry. Yeah, so the result was that the transfer was not really good.
