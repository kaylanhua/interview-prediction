"That's a good approach to content filtering and ensuring user privacy. Using regular expressions to sanitize user input is a common practice. Now, considering your experience with web scraping, can you describe a challenging scenario you encountered while scraping data and how you overcame it? What tools or techniques did you find most effective for handling the challenges in web scraping?","In web scraping, I have faced multiple challenges. I will describe each one in detail earlier first. We are used to scrape any very few sites like not to sites and scraping them is they are just static Pages like basic HTML if you load the website, you'll get the HTML you can just scrape it from there. But with the with the number of parties that are growing with the chatbot and the company we need to scrape multiple websites and each website comes in different formats. So I'm asked static websites some come as an infinite scroll upside and some commas like toggle ones like you have to use some feature like sidebar or something to scroll between the news articles. So yeah, what have done at this time was I used to study how these website is frame. Like what is the essential HTML structure that is followed and how is the class structure given to each component in the website and if there is any common class, how can you differentiate? Particular content I want from other ones which share this common class like using other properties or Keys available in the HTML tag and some kind of that. I had landed through debugging the site and doing some test runs and in finance clothing have done that with the puppeteer. Failure. We used access for simple scripting which doesn't work. Then we shifted to Puppeteer and when we shifted to Puppeteer when we automated this whole scraping and cleaning and everything process, we Face difficulties because of multi-threading what happened what used to happen was there used to be the scraper used to work on some websites. And if any website is loading slow, it used to exit after 30 seconds and it will not address it again. So then I resist about what are the other ways we can do then I got to know about Puppeteer clusters, which is essentially you open fights in a chrome instance and do balance scraping which increases the speed of scraping and also that also has a feature of sending back to the cube suppose if any site is a or any subside in a website, which we are supposed to scrape. He's a not loading fast. It could be due to network reason or it could be due to the server problem at the website holder itself What we have done was if any exception has happened during the scraping. We used to recent back into the cluster. So this class thank you maintains a list of URLs. It needs to scrape and when something is filled it is added back to the scraping happens until this all these URLs are scraped safely and embedded into the database and that is one difficult. I saw the property clusters and a we used to scrape only static sites, and then I converted into scrolling sites and INF. school websites, these are all I just done with Puppeteer and various extensions it has",4,3
"Training a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate volatility surfaces is a cutting-edge application. Could you elaborate on the specific techniques or modifications you applied to the VAE to ensure that it effectively captured the complex dynamics of volatility surfaces? Additionally, in the process of reducing the volatility surface to a lower-dimensional vector, how did you validate that the essential characteristics of the surface, such as skewness and kurtosis, were preserved in the generated samples?",You could fit a gaussian mixture model to the multivariate low latent data set and then you can see whether or not the number of components match the same where the distribution of the mixtures is. Roughly the same as the actual Market data. In terms of training the vae on the best method that actually worked was actually adding in a penalization term. For the wings on a VA and by penalizing for the variation the edges you're able to generate services that are more coherent in terms of the market space. So there are two factors. They're so the learning rate when training a v But ultimately the pin isation term is the best way.,2,3

"Certainly. When you were incorporating recent legal documents and newspaper articles into your training data, how did you address the potential noise in the data? In other words, what methods did you use to filter out irrelevant or inaccurate information to ensure that your NLP model was learning from the most reliable sources?",Actually at that time it was actually three years ago. My internship was a three years ago. So at that time we didn't have and we were at a very base level of startup. So we didn't have like the much more data to like evaluate or two filter out the noise from so we had a very compact data and we had to use all the data actually and it was select the data selected by the human experts so we didn't have to worry about the noise actually. So that's the thing.,1,2
"Using JMeter for API load testing is a solid approach. Given your experience with microservices architecture, how did you design the communication protocols between the microservices to ensure efficient and reliable data exchange, especially in a high-traffic scenario?","So we have utilized the, APIs endpoints and, the controllers we have as mentioned, have user risk controllers and the services are specifically, given the business, things capsulated between them, and we wrote the controllers that accept the, request given by the clients and the the response can be the controllers make use of the services, and then they will be, giving the, response to the client.",1,2

"It's good to hear that you're familiar with continuous integration and deployment, and that you've been using Postman for API testing and Selenium for automated testing. Your approach to testing with Postman, ensuring proper data format and using environment variables, is a solid practice. Verifying user roles and implementing a verification mechanism is also a key part of security and access control. As you continue to develop your testing skills, you might want to explore unit testing frameworks like Jest for Node.js applications or tools like Mocha for backend testing. Can you tell me about a time when you had to optimize a Node.js application for better performance, and what strategies or tools you used to achieve that?","Oh, I handled this by modifying my different different apis, for example, whether then rather than going to I implemented a exact path in react chairs. Well, the air was to I have to go to a particular path but a sub part of that URL was already in my room. So what it was going on. It was first going to that route respective of my complete your so I encountered that using exact path and regarding, you know performing my that so rather than using multiple files. Are you break my code into components in the reactants. So basically I was using the same piece of gold again and again, and I also go to which it was taking very few times to load that application and also using direct it's a single page application.

"Given your focus on selecting the most appropriate library for your needs, how do you approach the process of optimizing your code for performance, and what tools or techniques do you use to ensure that your solutions remain efficient and scalable?",so techniques like I would debug my code and whatever is input according to that what I need output whether it is correct or not. If it is leaving correct output or expected output or approximate output. Then I will consider it is working fine. If it is not giving I'll have to recheck and go through the libraries or what is the error it can give probability. I can just think of it and I can work again on that. Thank you.,1,2
"Given that, could you walk me through the process of creating a custom loss function in PyTorch and explain how you would ensure its differentiability for backpropagation?","Should the it's very easy to create a custom loss function pytorch because by General when you do anything with tensors you change them by default. So savior creating a very simple loss function just gives a difference right so you just to Define The functional functions name, so let's never lost. two inputs A and B now, we just need to find the loss between a and b and let's say we're doing a very simple loss is just a difference between a and b what we do is just return minus B. And in this case, it does same as now we have to make sure that NBA about tensors. for this tool because only if their tensors will record and will change the tenses together. So when you use lost or backwards it will so for this example lost function loss A. It just takes a comma BS important and the output is returned a minus B, which is a very simple loss function. We're not going for just for example And it turns the difference between them as the loss function. So once you have that you can just use lost a backwards back propagate on it. Later on.",1,2

So I would just rip out my whiteboard and I would draw in my laptop and I will show them by compared exactly. What's up.",1,2
"Fine-tuning the PLaNet model for summarization is a significant achievement, especially with the challenge of condensing complex information into a brief summary. Using L1 and L2 scores for evaluation is a standard practice in assessing the quality of summaries. Given your experience with deploying models on serverless GPU clouds, can you discuss any performance or latency issues you encountered during deployment, and how you optimized the model or the deployment process to ensure efficient summarization in a production environment?","Yeah, when we have first deployed on banana, it used to be slower response. Like it used to be like morale has to load by taking around 15 millisecond 15 seconds or something like that, which is very slow for someone who has pets an answer within seconds. Then what we have done tried is we contacted the owner of the I mean like the team of the banana team and team and then we accommodated about the speed and all they they have no other solution and that so then we tried other Solutions like another platform which provides GPU crowds then we tested again with the Run Port run pod use has very fast Implement compared to banana and even with several issues in times of speed then we tried exploring other ways in which we can generate speed answers slightly faster then we Then I explored about quantization which essentially reduces the parameters size into lowest size bits like 8 bit number and we quantize it the model using a library and after quantization. I tried it on the GPU itself how it is performing with respect to the one that is deployed on the cloud somewhere it is it was super fast. But at the time when I worked with it this Quant Models need a special GPU with their and that is not available in the Run Part. So then we got ahead with the general fine 21, which is faster than the banana. So right now there are many other improvements to the GPS as well. And this is something I had done 10 months back. So I think the modern solutions are much faster than that.",2,3
"It's clear you've integrated interpretability into your model development process. Shifting to a more technical focus, could you explain how you optimized the backend code for the ""BLIND ASSIST USING ML - OBJECT DETECTION WITH VOICE FEEDBACK"" project to ensure real-time performance, particularly with regard to the choice of data structures and algorithms?","Ah, yeah blind assistance using ml was so small project. I mean to say initially we got the data. I mean in image formats, so we called the Kokomo model with which is a good sense of model, which identifies what kind of object the image as So we tested for various images the Kokomo model gives where the object is present in particular image. I mean in the exact whether it is at the top left corner top right corner bottom right corner bottom left corner bottom center. So we will have the exact location of the object where it will be present by Como model. So we implemented we use your model to identify those along with models so that whenever object is being identified in the image. So we will get the Voice output which helps us a feedback for the blind people. So the video input or the Final End which the user sees in the camera or something will be converted to image and each image will be processed and then we will get the voice feedback. This is all the project works.",1,2
Thank you for outlining your approach. What potential challenges or constraints do you foresee in developing and deploying this real-time object detection system?,"So I'll be using YOLO v 5 small and, train the dataset, then I convert that model into t So I think there could be there could be challenges in improving the accuracies. Like, sometimes the model might find it difficult into, categorizing, like, babies or pets, so that we need to fine tune on not just humans from babies to humans and also pets So we'll first ensure that there are they are very there there are the model is very of good accuracies. After that, we'll try to convert into TF Lite version and try try to integrate the model. The challenges would be would be using the, GPUs that is available in devices because certain devices don't support GPUs. And also, the problem with Android is that, different Android phones behave differently with the codes. So you need to make a overall",2,3
"Implementing a salt for each user to enhance the security of hashed passwords is a strong practice. Could you elaborate on how you managed and stored these salts to ensure they remained secure and unique for each user? Additionally, for the hierarchical roles and permissions model, how did you handle the management and assignment of these roles to users or devices to ensure accuracy and prevent any unintended access?","Yes, I ensure that to be. Yeah for managing. For managing and storing is also we followed execute approaching. Each user salt was generated randomly and then securely stored along the side they're higher password. So this solves which stored in a separated data base or a file separated from the hash hash, you know passwords. This ensures are the even if the password data was compared compared to the sword you'd be reminded you to ensure this unique UV use a strong random number generated to generate the salt. This helps preventing any potential. Collisions or doable things by accessing a unique salt to each users. We further enhance the security of the hash marks for has has the permission model. We implemented a robotics management system the this this systems allows. It means or an organized users to Define and as an assigned to the users are a devices this management system provides and interface where rules could be created modified and assigned to a specific uses of the devices to ensure to ensure accuracy and preventing. Are preventing our implement we implemented Street Access Control within the management system. Only authorized users are the it means how to be able to assign role to user or a device as this helps preventing any unorganized changes or the prevents to sentence formation additional living incorporate power popular validation and verification mechanisms to ensure this role where a sign actually this this includes throughout the testing and validation process to come to come to confirm that the correct roles and the permissions were assigned to the integrated users or the devices by implementing this measures we were able to maintain the security and integrity of the salts and ensure actually assignment of role and permissions within the higher.

We used hyper parameter tuning in stock price prediction and we use features a feature Engineering in the loan eligibility program.,2,3
"Emphasizing the importance of AI as a supplement rather than a replacement for human teachers in maintaining the level of critical thinking and personalized guidance is a thoughtful approach. How do you envision the integration of AI engines with human teachers and mentors in traditional educational settings, and what kind of support or tools do you think would be most beneficial for educators in this context?",I guess the most beneficial tool for educators or technically be the AI tools that prepare notes and slides because it is a tedious task and it's mostly repetitive and we could automate on that and if the teacher can also get lecture notes so that they could recite and like explain topics much better and get resources. I think the class experience would be much more Interactive.,2,3
"Given the reliance on Intel's DPP implementation for performance optimizations, how did you approach the analysis to determine the most effective configurations for the EPYC servers? Additionally, can you discuss any specific metrics or methodologies you used to quantify and compare the performance impact of different configurations, especially in the context of large language models and other HPC workloads?","So the way we go about, so the way we go about to analyze which configuration is the best, is to do a, sweep on different parameters. For instance, in my large language model, the number of input tokens I give to the model is one such parameter which I can change. Similarly, the maximum output tokens, the model can generate is another parameter. And the number of course on which the model is being deployed at is one such parameter. So the way we go about it is we do a sweep from, the for each parameter and find out which parameter is giving us the best performance for that particular sweep. We also define a default configuration, which generally is the mean of every single configuration, every single parameter we have defined. And then we see that for each week, whether the performance is decreasing or increasing with respect to the default configuration, which I have defined. And once I understand that this particular data point is giving me the maximum performance, I define that to be my default configuration.",2,3

Great! I see from your resume that you've had a chance to work with OpenAI and PyQt during your internship at Unistring Tech Solutions. Can you tell me more about the application you developed and how you integrated OpenAI's capabilities into it?,"The application I developed was the basic function of the application was to convert flow diagrams. Like it is a hardware company. So the flow diagrams have to be converted into code the code consists of frontend and backend. So the basic front-end components are mostly similar in all sorts of websites and applications. So writing the front-end code is actually a redundant tasks. So the aim was to take a flow diagram and converted directly into code first. We focused on the front end part of the code and then started utilizing the capabilities of open a for the back end part of the code. The back end is a bit more tricky because the logic has to be optimized and that optimization capabilities not as enhanced. Yet off open air but otherwise front end part of the code was pretty clean, like the front and part of the code that open are generated was pretty clean. And hence. It was used. It was used extensively in the application. By QT was a framework used to develop the application that ingested. The flow diagram read it read the flow diagram with every like made sense of all the components and gave prompts to open are in such a way that it could give a readable and working code. So yeah, that's how the application worked and open AI was integrated open AI actually was integrated using the openai API. The free tour was used but once pushed to production the plan was to take a paid plan so that more number of people could use it use the application.",2,3

"Given the effectiveness of dropout in preventing overfitting, how do you select the appropriate dropout rate for your layers? Additionally, in the context of Vision Transformer models, which consist of both the attention mechanism and the MLP layers, do you apply dropout uniformly across these different parts of the model, or do you have a more nuanced approach to dropout application?","So both ways can be explored depending on the evaluation and how exactly the how and how exactly we are getting the results but I would say that the Dropout will should not be applied constantly over all the layers because some of the layers they do have a greater hidden parameters as compared to other layers. So if a layer has very high hidden parameters, then we can set a dropout rate a bit more higher as compared to a dropout rate of for the other layers. And for the final rail drop out is not needed because it generally like the weights and biases are already learned and the model is able to classify correctly which which we then passed to a softmax classifier directly without any trouble so that we get the correct classes.",2,3

"Using Truffle for testing and MythX for security checks is a solid approach. Can you elaborate on how you integrated these tools into your development workflow, and perhaps share how you addressed any vulnerabilities that were identified during the static and dynamic analysis?","So basically when we did a static analysis with mythics, so first radical is first, I need to mention that I use my fix and also I use filter so we found a certain vulnerabilities like so that are overflow underflow those kind of vulnerabilities were fixed using a new wind. So even using that you and some Library so we also have the math like math library of the 30 open simply Library. So using that we actually prevented the Overflow and underflow kind of situation for interiors. So also we did a manual identification of the potential security issues paying so we did this by checking the arithmetic operations and external calls of the particular functions. If there are function calls, then we are actually checking whether that function call could lead to other kind of exposure of the security breach. So those those things come from the statically in case of dynamic analysis. I I wrote the test tips so already I mentioned that I used mocha and chai as a description. So those tips were kind enough to judge the security or else the What to say also the use case checks that were done to to ensure that the court or the solidity smart contract at the time writing should ensure the proper if you execution. So those were part of some things also Dynamic analysis. I used in So at the first step of mine. I didn't I didn't directly implemented my smart contract to a blockchain or even not even taste Network. I implemented it. I did intimidation in the local blockchain. That is the ganache so ganache tool I used for the local deployment. And once I am very much assured that there won't be a much of loss then only I moved to the move to towards. So this where two men things that I did in in the broad line of static analysis and dynamic analysis. Yeah.",3,2

"Your approach to anomaly detection using ARIMA and a three-sigma threshold is a classic yet effective method, especially given the constraints of data availability and the need to minimize false alarms. For the FDC data, clustering is a powerful technique for identifying patterns and anomalies. Could you elaborate on the specific clustering algorithms you found most effective for FDC data, and how you validated the clusters to ensure they accurately represented normal and anomalous behavior?","Okay, so that is a very interesting question. And actually that is what made the task the most challenging for us now initially. Well, now the thing is one of the challenges of using the time series data is if you try to like initially I would use the hierarchical clustering method to Cluster based on the time series data, but that would take up too much amount of time. And because the production is a very fast process so it became like necessary that we can do it efficiently and like in a very short period of time so that's why what I did is at first I will use the PCA the principal component analysis method to do the dimensionality reduction on the time series data and bring it down to a 2d space. And now that we have it in the 2D space then I will use the clustering method. So here initially I started with the came in clustering method, but the problem with the came in clustering is it is like a distance Place method. So all the Clusters that will be formed is will always be in a circle. but in this particular case when you project it to the lower Dimension does not always mean that that they should be in the circular form like all the Clusters so it became more important to to take into consideration the the density as well as like the distribution of each of the like points. And so as far as the distribution based clustering is concerned so I use the gaussian mixture model for the clustering and yeah, so and then like what I will do is like for example during the training period I will have the Clusters and then I will note down like which pattern will belong to which clusters like by that I mean that even though the clustering is done on the two-dimensional space, but the pattern will then be Taken for the time series data and to take the pattern from the time series data. I will use the Battery Center method. So like Barry Center is similar to the center, but Center is for the two-dimensional or the three-dimensional data, but the Battery Center will be the center of the time series data now, I will Store The Battery Center in a library kind of thing. And that is the training part. And now then I will again do the clustering on the Testing period of the monitoring period and now I will try to see now after the Clusters has been done and the patterns are have been generated based on the time series data. I will try to check with the library like whether this patterns are already present inside the library or they are the new patterns now if they are already present inside the library and like because we already know that all the patterns inside the library is supposed to be from the budo if it's because no alarm was raised. So in that way we will try to like there were two ways either inside the Library if there is some pattern and the user have already informed us that this pattern is a bad pattern and if we get the same pattern in the monitoring period then we can directly say that these are bad patterns, but if a new pattern will come up which is not there inside our library and we don't know anything about it then all so we will try to inform the user about the new Pattern from the clustering that came up and like that will be kind of a Softail on to the user and they will check and verify and will fit back to us whether that pattern is a actual bad pattern or not. But because like clustering is a unsupervised method. So the important task here is to detect new patterns, and and we did that quite successful. Yeah.",4,3
Implementing early stopping is a common technique in machine learning to prevent overfitting. Are there any other regularization techniques or model architecture adjustments you consider implementing to further guard against overfitting and ensure your model remains generalizable to a wide range of inputs?,"Hike in machine learning I know about the regularization technique like Labs on Rigid, but I am not sure about in generative way.",1,2
"It sounds like you've implemented a straightforward tokenization strategy for your project, leveraging both default and custom tokenizers to handle the specific needs of your data. Given this experience, could you explain the concept of transfer learning in the context of natural language processing and how it might be applied to your pseudocode to code generation task?","short transfer learning is a very common process not just when LP but also for A computer vision as well, but transfer learning has gained its popularity in llms right now. So the point of transfer learning is when you have a particular deep learning model you train it on lots of data set the right. For example, let's take the ULM fit paper, which I know very summary because briefly because that was very pivotal. So this particular paper just took a large language model to some extent Transformers and training it on Wikipedia, right? So I just change the prediction next for prediction and sometimes even fill in the blacks prediction, right? So the idea is just to train the model on a large Corpus of data set. What this does is it generalize a model on a data set and for NLP Publishers, at least make sure that the model. Knows a lot of things about the language like English. It was a few string together sentences. And so give them this when you take this particular model and then you find your network to a particular task you bringing the experience in the weights of the model from previous huge task and then making sure it's focused on us. For example, we take the first one that is what a trained on Wikipedia data set. He was data set for next what prediction and we take these weights and we change the head of the classification of the transformer change it to something else. Say maybe a sentiment prediction very simple. This is subset of this because that's a entire language model that's predicting next to it. But this one. It just uses a few sentences and so on. To protect what the sentiment is now where this previous knowledge. It becomes very easy and the training converges very easy simpler in this particular product. So what we usually do is we freeze a few weeks not all the layers maybe Top Gear layers and then we find unit and this basically uses previous information and then fine tunes and better. So this makes the train faster and the train converges better.",4,3
"Excellent. Now, let's discuss the deployment. How would you deploy this real-time sentiment analysis tool to ensure it can handle large volumes of social media posts efficiently?","So in the deployment part, in, like, 1st stage model serving, in which I use platforms like, Net TensorFlow solving, TorchServe, or a custom Flask, Xango APIs for solving models. And in the scalability, like, ensures scalability scalability. I've ensured that using, containerization and orchestration. So And in the monitoring part, I use monitor I will use I've used models to monitoring and, like, performance and, since system health using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.",2,3

We have GPS we are we have a good number of CPUs and we have a good number of GPS to so for the system requirement. That won't be any issue.

"Your explanation of dynamic library linking and Pybind11 for seamless integration is quite detailed. How did you approach the testing and debugging of the C++ code that was integrated with your AI system, especially considering the need for high reliability in financial applications? What were some of the key strategies you employed to ensure the correctness and efficiency of the integrated C++ code?","Um, so one of the easiest ways to check if the generation strategy worked was to use the original python implementation and compare it against the C+ implementation. So you would get data generated from python only a very small amounts of the memory of a burn wasn't too large. Then you would do the same thing with C plus plus and effectively you would just get a distribution of data points and then you can statistically check whether the source came from the same distribution VA Colonel density methods or Paris plots and and very other methods like Matt Helena best distance and multivariate space. So statistically we would able to check the distribution that the data came from the same source.",2,3

Could you elaborate on the specific techniques or encoding methods you applied to ensure these features were effectively utilized in your machine learning models?","He said I have and I have used one hot encoding to shift the categorical data to numerical ones. Even though cat boost is the mainly famous for you know, handling categorical values catboost can handle categorical values very well, even though that happened I have you know implemented the same project using random Forest also, so to accommodate with that I have shifted my categorical values to numerical so I have used one whole 10 coding for the same.",2,3
What potential trade-offs or compromises might you need to make during the implementation of this real-time object detection system?,"So first, I'll I'll work with a very small dummy model for object detection using a same model to debug. That trade off could be, like, if I use very good model version like YOLO v YOLO v 10, big large version, that accuracy will be very high. But the model will be of too large size and using it on phones or some embedded device would be very difficult, and the latency will be very high. Such hardware support might not be available. So with little decrease in accuracy, we can achieve good, speed and, still have a manageable still have a except sufficient accuracies with that. Like, instead of using more of heavy models with high accuracy, I will try to use some, lightweight models like small version instead of using large version of YOLO. And try to check if the those models are giving sufficient accurate for the production environment. And then I'll compromise I will compromise, high accuracy with a slightly low accuracy, but for faster speed.",3,4
"That's quite impressive, especially the use of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 for natural language processing. Given the scale of the documents and concurrent users, how did you ensure the performance and scalability of your model, and what specific Azure services or features did you leverage to handle the load?","Okay, so basically to specifically based upon how I met I basically manage to work on scale. I have used various algorithms here for making sure that it serves to a number of users and more than 10 to 15,000 users at a similar time. I have used Azure kubernetes services and we have used a load balancing reaching microservice architecture. So basically we have when we have Microsoft picture we the failover is reduced. We have applied Azure monitoring Services here to monitor, which Microsoft is down which microservices up and we have used a task you here basically to accept concurrent requests and parts it based upon the backend. We have used Azure repayment orders killing of of chapter 15 AP. And ensure that the we have getting quality results, we are we have a lot of manual automatic and integration testing. We have we have them it's more than 10 to 15,000 iterations of testing for based upon the integration tests so that we can be sure that we the results we are getting in final production are on a good quality. We have used Azure data drift detection. We have base upon some mattresses like similarity score and Blues score to check whether the results that are going in real time at So that's all about it.",2,3
"Leveraging open-source solutions and staying updated with the latest research through platforms like Hugging Face is a solid strategy. When it comes to implementing these cutting-edge techniques in a smartphone environment, what are the key considerations you keep in mind to ensure that the models are not only compressed effectively but also run efficiently on the limited hardware resources of a smartphone?","Basically, before compression, we try to see the efficiency of the model in a normal environment. Like, in a busy environment or over a cloud. And if you see that the, efficiency of that model is good, then we plan about compressing and we compress it based on the, smartphone capabilities. So, basically, if a model requires, like, 8 GB RAM, to, be executed in a device, then we just try to execute on devices which have minimum of, like, 12 GB RAM. So that the model has some, hardware, available for it to be executed effectively. If the smartphone itself has a 4 GB RAM, and the model can execute only for a 8 GB RAM, then basically we try to still compress and see, like, whether that can be, integrated to that particular device. And, obviously, if the effects are not good, then we just don't try to optimize or compress it for that smart smartphone. We just go for the higher end models.",2,3
"That's a comprehensive explanation, thank you. Now, considering your experience with NLP and the development of a chatbot for real estate agents, could you walk me through how you approached the challenge of training and fine-tuning the LLM model for this specific domain, and what kind of performance metrics you found most valuable in evaluating the chatbot's effectiveness?","Right. So in this scenario, we incorporated a rasa NLP based model, which was an intent and entity based model. It had a two-part solution for fine tuning Incorporated to or two sections. The first was to train the model for the intent recognition when we had just a handful of intents that is to identify. Whether a query was a listing based query whether the query required solution for real estate agents or whether open houses or mortgage related questions. These were the questions that we needed intent recognition for so it became fairly easy to provide examples of intense belonging to each of these in each of these classes each of these labels and along with that for for the entities that we wanted to extract. We had already composed already had an extensive database wherein we recorded all sorts of Different entities that were relevant in different queries like locations language is that language is that real estate agents spoke or specific? Zip codes are neighborhoods where the listings were located in the kind of community that the particular address was a part of Etc. So all of these different parts different entities became the training data for us and Using these data we find the rasa and you along with the rasa and will be libraries itself. We utilize these this data to find you in the model and just better support our use case which was the compass spot. So the bot operated in this manner wherein it could identify messages on the agency the post that agents made in a LinkedIn Lake Network, which was called Asian feed and it answered or recommended solutions to their queries as comments another section. Another front where the compost bought was very handy was on in real estate agent agent base slack groups wherein it could identify the entrance of the messages of the queries that uses posted and then answer these queries with a bunch of recommendations by identifying the intense of these queries and then providing some a list of top 10 recommendations for each of these queries.",4,3

Given your experience with GPT-3, can you discuss any specific techniques or fine-tuning you applied to the model to ensure the generated content was not only coherent but also tailored to the sales context?","Oh, yes. So this is small clarification here. So we we didn't we were not using the GPD 3 we got we went with the GPT 4 model. Who is the latest model of openai? So yes, we did a very like the prompt engineering part was the most difficult part. I would say like we used to find tune the prompts again and again, so that that was on up the important expect of the project like we try to tailor it as for our use case like also like while giving the example prompt so we met here like the model should not have you seen it so that's so we like if there are any sections like let's say Coast saving or Revenue section. So those includes numbers and in order to make ensure that the model doesn't hallucinate so we try to give it step by step loading. We use Chain of Thought prompting all so you you several different from techniques in order to get a tailored response from the model and popularity now sells deck.",3,2

Like I said, I changed the automation framework and I installed the newest version of MongoDB, which is version 7 in the system. The challenges faced were there were a lot of changes was happened from version 4 to version 7, and a lot of parameters as well as flags were changed. So I had to go to the scripts of install the new version firstly.

We have a demo so we call this the Sprint bit. So in this particular demo mint every team has every member from every single team has to show whatever they have done in the past two weeks along with the statistics. So this gives us an idea of what the other teams are doing as well as what is the state of our product in in phases in the other team for example in this co-pilot product or the Nova project after we have done it. We have handed over to the testing and the monitoring team. So what they have done what statistics they have come up with this focus is that in the moment.

So what what we did in this object detection model is like how long we were able to you know, we had our own business metrics to track and the thing is we wanted the ball always we wanted the call always to be treated. So if in any frame you are missing the ball, the ball was not able to identify that's where we're trying to reduce our score. So the we had our own metric which we build for this what we did is let's say we have 16 minutes of video in 60 minutes of video how long our camera was able to detect it. Let's say if it is detecting for 59 minutes then that means it is pretty good. So let's say let's talk about 100 minutes right in 100 minutes. We detecting it in 1999 minutes. That means it's 199% accurate. We were able to detect that ball. So that's our own metric which we build to make this make a two.

So see nobody wants to wait for anything and let's say I had added a filter on the dashboard. I just wanted to be updated in a second. I don't want to wait a 10 20 30 seconds to be updated. So for that I had searched it on so for that I had used two different it up bases one that has the raw views the other that has reviews as well as the Sentiment and all the keywords that we that we are extracting from that specific review.

Great! I see from your resume that you have a strong background in image processing and time series analysis. Can you tell me about a particularly challenging computer vision project you worked on at TSMC and how you approached it?,"Well, one of the problem that that I initially did was based on the pattern matching of the images because we know that in the in the chip design there are multiple repeating patterns as an example. We know that the Apple M1 chip and the M2 Chip now if you those who know about the physical diagrams of the both M1 and the M2, they will know that there are multiple components of the M1 and the M2 that are repeat like multiple components of M1 that are repeated in M2. Now when this kind of request when because tsmc is the production company, so and Apple only provides the basic diagram that design now when this request comes the tsmc engineers need to rework it so that they can be manufactured into the ship. But when the customer gave from the M1 to the m to the tsmc engineers will not know. Which portions of the cheaper repeated now my project it helped them to exactly locate the coordinates that are repeated like for those patterns like one pattern may be repeated four times and what are the precise code in? Its of those? Repeated patterns and similarly there are multiple such such patterns and all the coordinates of those patterns were recorded and which helped to maybe reduce the workload of the tsmc engineers by 50% So by that it means that probably earlier if for example to take eight hours to do a work now with all the information they can finish it by maybe four hours or something like that.

Like I was using in I was like, they're not directly utilizing the mainly overflow under for overflow underflow. Let me let me just think about that once once a bit like Yeah, so basically in some cases I was actually using the so just a moment in some cases. I was using the under for underwear and overflow. The main issue was like it was hitting the ceiling. So at that point whenever it was heating the feeling it was just revolving revolving back to the starting point now actually it is getting underflow and overflow so that for and so once like for even two to six, I have a range of 256 to 56, there are actually a number of which so once it is getting overload. I am getting back to the 0-0 so that because of that so not actually true 56 it is it's too close to 56 minus one number of values that I can actually use with six as a length of the maximum number of Maximum value that can be it would you",1,2
"I appreciate your detailed explanation of how the modular API approach facilitates the addition of new features. In terms of monitoring, how do you ensure that you have sufficient visibility into the performance of each API endpoint and the overall system, especially in terms of response times and error rates?","Okay.

We have kept it time and for every six hours we have plotted the different kinds of grass that could be possible starting from the response time then starting from the response time of each of the individual apis. Now, if a particular API fails then then what are the problems is so all of this monitoring we have done part by part since everything is in a modular structure that helps us in the way. So we did the monitoring in this way. However, there is a separate team for this testing on the monitoring. So I think in a company every team has their own responsibilities, so our task is to build the system and to deploy the system and to be responsible for anything that happens to the system however for monitoring and testing other things are there who knows whatever is exactly done for this project in much greater detail.",2,3

So we just use the inbuilt function. So ours was work was based on using PyTorch, actually. So PyTorch has a inbuilt function for LoRa. We just use the inbuilt function present in PyTorch for the LoRa optimization. And we try to, reduce the ARR.",1,2
"I understand that for a basic sentiment analysis project, simpler approaches are often sufficient. Given the scope of your project, how did you ensure that the model remained robust and generalizable, especially when deploying it to handle new, unseen data? What steps did you take to validate the model's performance on a test set, and how did you handle any overfitting that might have occurred during training?","Oh, yeah. So what we had to do was to bring in new test cases for validating the answers. And in that case our model was not overfitting due to having a different different data all there so that way we handled over fitting.",1,2

Great! I see from your resume that you have a strong background in data science and machine learning. Can you tell me about a specific project where you utilized Azure for data analysis and what tools within Azure you found most beneficial?,"When it comes to my work experience, I would like to explain about what I have done in my previous EX. my current company so I have come have a more than two years of experience and Tata consultancy services and during my tenure at TCS board past two years have been involved in a role of machine learning engineer where it was around Microsoft CRM Analytics. I specialize in building mostly regression-based models and these models help us in predicting Trends and outcomes based on different data patterns. In a day-to-day life, I usually spend significant Time by training and finding these models and models like a research CV and Hyper parameter optimization to improve the model performance. And these model finally containerized using the docker and to organize your pipelines in Azure devops environment and to ensure that is to be held all the time. So and being attacked in this yes, I held a certification in what as your and AWS as well. And that's all in short about me. Yeah.",2,3
"Exploring the use of different forms of regularization, such as layer normalization, weight normalization, or sparse regularization, through custom callbacks is indeed a forward-thinking approach. Could you detail how you would go about creating a custom callback that dynamically adjusts the application of a specific form of regularization based on the model's performance? This could involve a form of ""adaptive regularization"" that responds to the model's behavior during training.",adaptive visualization techniques would dynamically adjusted civilization strength during the training process based on this certain criteria that we give it I and they aim to provide a more flexible and responsive approach to Stabilization by being more Dynamic and changing time to time. During the process a few examples of adaptive regulation would be adaptive recognization on the idea is a very strength of Alvin or L2 regularization during the training process on the behavior of the model. So the way it works would be the regulations changes dynamically adjusted based on criteria is the magnitude of the model perimeter or the gradient updates Implement can be implemented by introducing adaptive terms in the regularization and in which are updated during training.,1,3
"Thank you for your detailed response. How do you ensure the ethical use of AI and machine learning in your projects, particularly in areas like surveillance and sentiment analysis?","1st, first of all, we need to make sure that the data that we have collected is from authorized resource authorized sources. Like, we take permission from the owner of the data, and the peer the anyone or any entity that is involved in in that data, we need to take permissions from that. Also, in whichever zone those AI solutions or object detection solutions are employed, it should be clearly indicated in that area is that such they are under surveillance and in there that data has been collected for training and improvement of the AI solution. So these things will be made clear to the people who are going to use those solutions. And, as a developer, I'm as a AI engine engineer and developer, I must also ensure that the data that I use are are legal and free available to be used. I do not use anything unlawfully.

"It's understandable that evaluating session-based recommendation systems can be challenging. As you explore traditional evaluation metrics, what specific challenges do you anticipate in applying these metrics to your graph-based system?","Um the first and the foremost soil challenges, we can't really show what recommendations will what are the recommendations that we are going to show next because like for the search query we can expect a customer to give us some 10 to 20 or 30 maybe a queries and their expected services, but for the recommended system, the customers are not sure what what will we are? Not sure what will be asked and again when we talk about with this with customers. They're like we want to show something but we are not really sure we what we don't want to show so Again, we are not really sure about this.",1,2
"Absolutely, Flask's capability for creating APIs is crucial in deploying machine learning models. Could you detail a particularly challenging aspect you encountered while deploying a machine learning model through Flask and how you addressed it?","Oh, yes while doing a chatbot project like creating a chatbot project. I used flask and and while deployment of that model I faced a critical situation like defining routes was over read. very like challenging for me as a Like defining particular route to a particular page I can say or to a particular feature I can say is is a bit challenging. And in machine learning model deployment and but like a referring to different research papers and Fringe to different methods or ways I can use flasks API. I was I was able to tackle this situation.",2,3
"That's insightful. Regarding the Python libraries you mentioned for optimization, which specific libraries did you experiment with, and what led you to ultimately choose the ones you used in your project?","Okay. So for optimization I used biomol library, then cycle and side by these three libraries. We were mainly using for optimization and piom. We just wanted to have a rate of differential of the numbers. We were having. So in that case we used by homo and cycle and side piece for some of the mization issues to resolve which we were plotting matplotlib. It's related with that. Thank you.",1,2
"Given your experience with optimizing the Flask app and the use of Kafka for asynchronous processing, what specific challenges did you encounter with multiprocessing, and how did you address them to ensure the system's stability and performance?","Okay. Um, so like there can be it's a very wide. topic actually and it is something that we all had to explore because firstly we would have so we have a service for Extracting our data from contracts, right? So contracts would be in textual format files which have been scanned. They will be in the form of PDFs or they can be in the format of docx. Right? So the extractions are done by a separate service, which was not part of our team. Right and the problem was that they were also scaling from their end. Right? And now what happens is when I'm running my code async code and I'm utilizing their ABA is in inside my code and I'm using I'm as well using multiplication, right? So it's like it's like I'm calling them versus function and inside that there is another function that is calling a process for process for function. Right? So it was recursively spawning, right? They were followers of that their We could see that we were recursively spawning a lot of processes and we have to we had to look into it why we are creating that many processes and that was one of the very important thing that we noticed after that other one is of maintaining a global state of model. Right? So once the models are loaded into our flask program, we would want all our Kafka topics. We want all our Kafka consumers to be having a separate state where they are maintaining their each of them are entering their model state, right? So for example, if I'm having a Kafka topic of let's say language detection, I wouldn't want Just to the space that topic is having for language detection. I wouldn't want to share it with let's call it language translation, right? So that separation of concern is there and that thing is pretty it is it is easier to do it in let's say threading but That is not something that works pretty well in Python, right? We have Gil, right? So we are using we are working the processes and then we are serving the topics. So that was issue. Another one was the issue of instrumentation of apis because since we are using Kafka and it is a message messaging based system and it is not an API based system and it is a sink. So instrumentation was also very tough for me because I had to prove it to my I have to show it to my leaders right that whatever steps that I have taken. They will they are conclude. There is some conclusion. There is some data behind it. Right? I wanted to connect some data and I wanted to collect some stats and that was all very tough to do because of the async nature of Kafka.",4,3
The use of LAMA for model debugging and refinement is quite innovative. How did you select or design the prompts to ensure the model's responses and the subsequent explanations remained clear and actionable for the end user?,"The Prompt is enter independent on the core expertise consider if it is a different scenario. And we can't see this particular prompt a look for that scenario the scenario. So what we did is we had 1000 collection of data so which is 1000 prawns which we collected from the people who is really working with different scenarios, like conservative. It is a sonar based application. So they'll analyze the sonar and they'll see whether this particular region is for this class or sheep or might be playing that is captured and the water they will give a brief description about this features contributed for this classification. And hence. This is considered plane that data is collected and that data is processed with the class label using bird that is ultimately a Q&A what that was answered the features collectors simplifies the features consider you have a kind of features that what happens is it will select this particular features for this particular classic piece, even if you upload a video the model will learn just the features or collected and this Vector might be representing these Foods. So that is how the words are captured.",1,2
"Your approach to preprocessing and fine-tuning the GPT model is very thorough. It's clear that you've put a lot of thought into crafting the right prompts and providing sufficient training examples for the model to learn from.

Did you use any specific techniques or tools to monitor the model's performance and make adjustments as needed?","Yes. Yes, like every time I used to give some some data labeled data set where I have so I have trained my model with enough number of training data set and then have taken some unseen data set and then I have tested my model if my model was not giving good result. If the output was not good it all if output was not what I was expecting in in the format, which I was not expecting then I'll revisit the prompt I have given and I have my I will make the necessary adjustments and I will make sure that my prompt using my my prom chat GPT has understood my problem and what I am expecting then based on that prompt and changing the number of training samples it gave a good result.",2,3
"DistilBERT is indeed a great choice for its efficiency. Given that you've worked with DistilBERT, can you explain how you fine-tuned the model for your specific use case? What kind of training data did you use, and how did you handle the fine-tuning process to ensure the model learned the nuances of sentiment in the context of your application?","So my application was most of the Amazon reviews. It's not something. It has the option that whether the user can write his own reviews and check whether the sentiment is true and false, but it mostly focuses on the reviews of a specific product. So let's say Samsung has a phone and they want to check the how do the analysis of the reviews that people are saying so they can just feed the reviews to the data. It will just give you the output of all the reviews and it can summarize it too. So the digital but which I had used comes from a library called flare sentiment. Now the best part about the place in 20s said it is already pretty tuned on a movie theater set movie review data set from MTV as well as from the Amazon review data set. So I had manually check for around 500 to 1,000 reviews. Yeah around 1000 reviews and it was performing pretty well. There was a slightly one or two and biggest cases. One or two percent of ambiguous cases where we had some issues, but I haven't done much of a fine tuning on it. It was giving quite a good result out of the box.",2,3

So there was no complexity problem, which I finished.",1,2
"Great! I see from your resume that you've worked on a financial question answering system at JP Morgan. Can you elaborate on the specific challenges you faced while developing this system, and how you addressed them?","Okay. So one of the mid so basically Financial question answering system is like you have a lot of annual reports and you have some questions on let's say the finances of the top 500 companies. So what S&P 500 companies so what that essentially that ask is you have the question you first you have to retrieve relevant reports then retriever limit when pages from those reports and then answer the question. So one of the most daunting task is was related to retrieving the relevant contacts for answering the question. And another task was how do you refine numerical reasoning using large language models? So for retrieval task, I trained a binary classifier using Advanced method of negative sampling which was placed on clustering and for the prompting will you enhancing numerical reasoning through prompting? I actually created came up with a new methodology which used questions from the training set. As an in-context learning as in context learning examples and also created Chain of Thought problems using GPS 35. So for this training questions, we had all the reasoning steps the final answer which helped in model to understand what kind of calculations it needed to A to answer the question. Yeah, that's it, I guess.",4,3
I appreciate your insight on choosing between CNNs and RNNs based on the nature of the data. Could you now explain the process of feature selection in the context of machine learning and elaborate on any techniques you find particularly effective for this task?,"Suddenly suddenly. so it the feature selection you are saying so first thing like I would like to focus on here is the correlation analysis, so what happens is so you can like you if like you don't want to include highly correlated features and while training a model because those would cause a high bias. So you would like to remove similarly correlated features like the features that have high correlation among them like you can Keep one and remove the rest like that is one of the process and the second one. I would suggest this the most important part is the domain knowledge. Like you can always keep the features are important features as for your domain knowledge. Like and like there are different methods of ADA like even on there is another method called PCA principal component analysis, which highlights the most important features and keeps them. So it's like there are like these are some of the methods data pre-processing methods that you can use to for feature selection.",2,3

So the sentimental analysis was for the reviews of companies employees on let's say Glassdoor platform. So in that case, we got the data from Glassdoor and we use various models XD boost random forest and all other models to get Get the data sorted into sentiments like positive and negative and we used confusion Matrix for finding the accuracy of the models. Other than that. We also added test case and training training data and testing data and we use those to find accuracy of models.

"It's impressive how you've combined BM25 for initial retrieval and BERT for ranking and response generation. Given your experience with Django, can you discuss a specific challenge you faced while working with Django and how you overcame it? Additionally, how do you ensure the security of a Django application, particularly when handling user data?","Okay, so the Django applications? I was recently working on a on an application a campus delivery application which basically works for our college campus. We have a certain number of food outlets and people can order from any one of those Outlets but the pricing and the food quality differs from place to place also the distance between the place and the student location varies. So having a single app that can contend all of this information and he's out the process of placing orders for the users as well as the vendors which are the cafe owners in the campus easier. So that was the application. I was working on using Django. So one of the major or difficulties that I faced well developing the application this application was that when Django Pages go on interactive or not supported on the web on the actual deployed website the A figuring out where the error is becomes very difficult. So it is not a very commonly known method especially to beginners, but When one uses Django dot settings dot notify it helps the it makes the page display where the error is exactly where it is and exactly exactly how it can be. Addicted in the case of your specific application. So that was one error and how I tackled it apart from that.",2,3
Those are some insightful challenges you've identified. Let's discuss the potential impact or benefits of successfully solving this problem. How do you think implementing this machine learning pipeline will benefit the company and its operations?,"Okay. So, few things. So the thing is initially, we had a team of 30 QC people, which used to manually mark, all the issues in these orthomosacs, which was really time consuming. So once we have built this pipeline and we were kind of able to quickly experiment with model. So model experimentation was time was also reduced by a single day. Because we had to experiment with the different hyperparameters, which we had to initially change and see how it is going to fit. Now we have single configuration file where we cannot directly change the parameters and pass it to the pipeline. Next was, that, the work or the manual work by the team of this, QC people. Was reduced by a lot because now the model is used to detect, all the issues in the solar power plants. And then, they only need to recheck it. So the model accuracy was around 70 to 18%, which kind of helped the team to deliver the projects to the client much faster. So we kind of have cut the project delivery time by 40 to 50% depending on the size of the auto or size of the power power plant site. So faster delivery and faster experimentation. That these are the 2 things that we kind of accomplished for, by developing this pipeline. So faster experimentation is for us, ML team, and this faster delivery of the project process is, kind of, something that we were able to accomplish across organization. So when we are able to faster deliver, so we are also able to complete more projects in less time.",4,3

Using a recurrent neural network for this real-time application is a solid choice. How did you handle the training and inference processes to ensure the model could make these drowsiness predictions in real-time with minimal latency? Did you implement any specific optimizations or techniques to streamline the inference process?,"So the thing is that, the, the main case, dividing the, data into, training and testing sets and performing all everything on the training set and checking if the test set works in a correct manner or not. In that way, we are able to achieve the if there are any false positives or true negatives kind of things.

"That's a solid approach. Can you dive into the technical details of how you analyzed and characterized these workloads? Specifically, what metrics or parameters did you find most useful in differentiating between the workloads, and how did you extract and analyze this data?","So we had to define our own parameters and, metrics, catering to the specific workload. For instance, if I'm doing a large language model characterization, the parameters which I defined were time taken, for the entire workload to be run. Time taken for the first token to be generated, as well as the number of tokens generated in one second. Those were the metrics I defined for my large language model workload. Also, for the MongoDB workload which I worked on, the parameters were the number of reads and writes which happened per second, depending on which subcategory of workload am I studying. All these studies were done in Excel, so the data was in, gathered using a Python script. The Python script created a CSV file from which I took the data, and I put it in a Excel sheet where I did analysis based on how how are my metrics changing when I change certain parameters.",3,4
"Let's dive into the technical skills listed on your resume. Starting with Data Structures and Algorithms, can you explain how you would optimize a basic algorithm like Bubble Sort for a large dataset, and what the resulting Big O notation would be for your optimized solution?","Okay. So as you read my, you know to like data sector to optimize the basic algorithm like a bubble short for a large data set. I would Implement an optimization technique known as early termination of flying. So like I will tell you how it works like during each part during each pass through the array. I would introduce a flag variable to track whether this webs were made. If no swaps occur during a pass. It indicates that the array is already sorted and we can terminate the Sorting process early. So after it creating through the entire array and Performing comparisons, if a swap is made I said the flag variable to true no swaps are made you think about I said the flag variable to false after completing a full pass through the array if of leg remains false, it indicates that no swaps were made and there is sorted and this point I terminate the Sorting process. Then like so the average case time complexity of bubble sort with early termination remains wins. Where n is the number of elements in the air. However, the best case time complexity improves to when in scenarios where the array is already sorted as a determination prevents unnecessary iteration. Of course, we have to test that to solar. So by implementing early termination in bubble sort. I can optimize the algorithm to achieve better performance for large data sets, especially in scenarios where the air is partially sorted or nearly sorted this optimization reduces the number of comparisons and swaps required leading to improved efficiency. Yeah.",3,2

You've given a comprehensive overview of how you optimize models and handle various techniques in machine learning. Could you now explain the concept of 'overfitting' and discuss some strategies to prevent it in machine learning models?,"yes, so over fitting is basically when you in general words, we can say that when you get a higher highest accuracy in your training data, but you get very low accuracy in your testing data, right so basically overfitting occurs when there is a high variance in the model and less bias, so there the overfitting occurs and model tries to fit every like data point in its generalization whereas underfitting like Is when the there is a high bias and low variance. Okay. So model the just stretches and generalize line and do not care about various outliers and classifieds now to prevent some the reasons for overfitting our Highway variants and low buyers. The model is too much complex and its not ready to use on a simpler data the size of the training data can be also big these are the reasons for overfitting also to reduce the overfitting we can increase the training data reduce the model complexity if we are using suppose a neural network and we can decrease the layer so decrease the layers so that the models complexity is reduced then all right early stopping during the train. Phase like have an eye over the loss over the training period as soon as loss begins to increase the stop the training then also there are methods like Ridge regularization and lasso regularization. And yeah again, as I said that using the Dropout for neural networks to tackle overfeeding are some kinds of techniques we can generally use to come out of overheating. or reduce",4,3

So to be like you I used to read the recent research papers published in reputed conferences. So I used to read the abstract and I tell if it is relevant to my work is to download that and go through that paper and if that sounds interesting and if those things are somewhat relevant to my work, then I will try to replicate that paper by searching for the code or by directly emailing the author for the code so that I can use his work and take something for work. So when I was working on graph convolution networks for hyperspectral image classification, I was getting a decent accuracy, but not very good accuracy. Then they have seen a paper where they have used Latin space. They have just encoded decoder to project. A hyperspectral image and Latin space and after the Latin space project using the laden Express projected data, they have performed convolution based classification. So I have took this thing and included in my upcoming including in my upcoming projects where I have I will take an auto project hyper spectral image into Latin space to reduce the dimension, then the light and space projected data will use that data for graph.

The proactive approach to email notifications for data issues is also a good practice for ensuring that the team is aware of and can address problems promptly. Given your experience with creating and maintaining ETL pipelines, how do you approach version control and testing for these pipelines to ensure that changes are implemented smoothly without disrupting the data flow?","So therefore version controlling systems we can use Azure GitHub and sorry GitHub services and Azure repos so that we can maybe calculate all these repository management for data for creating a versioning of data. We can use Azure data. We can use databricks. For feature store basically store all the features into a system where data scientists machine learning Engineers can collaborate and they can basically go through the hooks and Crooks of data and it has consistent across the system. So we for core management we can use the repository management tools like fees Azure reports get lab or GitHub and for data management, we can use reader versioning we can use Azure data Factory. Sorry data bricks. Feature store. So yeah, these are the two techniques which you can use.",2,3
Great! I see from your resume that you've worked on a project for the detection of network communication anomalies. Could you walk me through the machine learning techniques you applied in that project and how you ensured a high accuracy rate?,"Oh, yes. So the machine learning techniques, I was given a data set where it contained the destination address the source address the IP addresses and all of it. I applied a lot of database processing and data cleaning techniques. And then I applied the models the classification models. The problem statement was to was to classify if there is an anomalous Behavior or there is a normal behavior. So it was a binary classification problem and no it was a multi-class classification problem where I have to give the class of attack or the anomalous behavior that is being done there. So the models machine learning models that I have applied were the artificial neural networks the gradient boosting classifier random Forest classifier decision tree classifier logistic regression classifier multi-class logistic regression classifier and so on I achieved an average accuracy on all these models in around 1999 around 99.2% accuracy and the highest accuracy that was from random Forest where it gave me an accuracy of around 199.5% Yes.",2,4
"Your approach to balancing gas optimization with maintainability and readability is commendable. Avoiding certain data structures and control structures to reduce gas costs while ensuring the code remains understandable is a thoughtful strategy. Given your emphasis on code quality, how do you document your smart contracts to make it easier for other developers to understand the gas optimization decisions you've made? Do you use any specific documentation practices or tools to help with this?","So for smart contract documentation, what I did actually is like I always put comments. So comments comments in every function or every some effect if I'm doing some logical actions or logical code, even a small logical piece of code could be could not be understood unable by by the another coder. It's not aware of smart contract. So I made the code so much simple that with the comments. It could be understood by other people's who is actually not a blockchain developer, but coming from the background from a traditional technology background should should be understanding my code as simple as possible. So there are context structures so In that case, I would say I I did plan a plan or a model of high level overview of each components and it rolls. So as I said at this beginning of my discussion with you, I already mentioned that there were particular sections of people's so there were admin there were users as the as the borrowers and also the as a library management has hole is has to be owned by someone. That's the Superman so all the structure I planned before executing my or starting with my writing of the smart contract. So this actually ensure that whenever I am writing the code it is already planned in a head back back ahead. So back in time basically, and also I did the writing of the functions function naming modifiers and events. All those things were properly handled and also I used error handling as a technique of for for as a technique for If I am getting any error, that should be held at you using an air handling clicks. So I already mentioned you the point of security considerations. I tested my content. I tested my contract in all possible measures that could be possible for a secret debris as of my not as a mine total absolutely level of knowledge. This all techniques from me that I am actually making a match your code that could be understandable implementable and mental to the other people's and it can be for the deployed to production as well.

"It's interesting that fine-tuning the layers and adjusting dropout values led to improved results for your translation tasks. This kind of experimentation is key to optimizing model performance. When you fine-tune a model, how do you decide which layers to adjust, and what strategies do you use to prevent overfitting, especially when working with a limited dataset, as is often the case with low-resource languages?","So yes overfitting is a frequent problem that we encounter when working with a limited data sets like a smaller data sets. So what we the methods that we used in that project were very limited because again, the data set was very small. It was just 200 words long the data set we had So in that we used. We experimented with the layers like I said and apart to. To avoid overfitting what we did was introduce some negative examples as well some negative or data points as well. So that it so that the model knows which is an act surely correct translation and which one is not that really helped avoiding overfitting because as me is also very easily inherits from Sanskrit and introducing Arabic words. Help help reduce overfitting as a scene element as seen in the project.",2,3
"The use of explainable AI techniques, such as LIME, combined with custom model ensembling for both visual and textual data, is quite innovative. How did you manage the trade-off between model accuracy and the additional complexity introduced by these explainability methods, especially in a production environment like Amazon's?","To be more precise explainer as a postdoc technique, which means that it is independent of the developed model, which is the machine learning or even deep learning model. Thus explainer is used just for verifying the performance of the model and when it comes to complex scenarios or critical Edition making scenarios will utilize the explainer. The explainer is ultimately a different model that will only predict the features of the model. Which is a already created or developed model. So the complexity is not affected by this explainer.

Great! I see from your resume that you've led a team on search optimization and recommender systems at Grazitti Interactive. Can you elaborate on the specific techniques or algorithms you've found most effective in this leadership role?,"Oh, yeah. So first of all for the search of we were using elasticsearch as the base search engine, but it has its own limitations. So we move to more, you know, semantics based approach, which is Vector search. So we use different deep learning models like expert which is all mini based LM the like at that time. It was at the first at the ranking of empty net. So we use that and it has an image of 386 and we use that as a form making the vectors of the text. And we integrated the semantic search. But and now we have reached like we have our own Benchmark at around meditation. So or search was that around 62 65% at that time, but when we included semantic search and we went we went through it. So the benchmarking Spike up to around 85% So right now we are working on these things and one more thing that we are now embedding it to it is LTR. It's basically learned to rank. So to basically take the user feedback taking the user clicks on and Above and try to assign ways to the article when a query is sourced. So that's how the ranking is now being improved. Another thing we are. Focusing right now is using LMS. So we are basically doing some poses on query expansion. We are using now knowledge graphs for because we have new feature of to forged for the generative answer and we have integrated the gpt's so now we are building a semantic waste step drag applications. We are doing places on it. We have you used embedding with face index. We are now exploring the knowledge graphic which basically a graphic we see So yeah, so we are doing a this. right",4,3
"That's a very interesting application of computer vision for pattern recognition. Given the complexity of chip designs and the need for high accuracy, could you elaborate on the specific computer vision techniques or algorithms you used to achieve this pattern matching? And how did you ensure the robustness of your solution to handle variations in the patterns?","Yes, so that is true. And for that initially how I will start is because the chip is very the original design of the chip is very it's very large and now like because there may be multiple repeating patterns. What I will try to do is at first I will try to do the fuzzy matching. So I will take each of the patterns from the M1 and try to look at like I will do the convolution across the image and then I will try to find the fuzzy locations. Now, it may happen that while fuzzy matching is happening then each of the pattern will have multiple similar matching coordinates. So from there to have the exact coordinates, I would use the intersection of the unions and then from those intersection of the unions. I will know and also like in with intersection of the unions, I will use that ssim so as I am is the index that helped me to realize that how close those two images are and now this images are actually not the physical drawing they are the pattern density. Maps now because of this there may be some there may also be some data loss associated with it. Now, we cannot do anything for those places where the data is lost but for all the other places we found we would help to create give them the exact matching using the IU ssim and the fuzzy matching with the with the convolution method. And and and and and the idea is that that filter for example, like similar to what we do in the CNN methods here in state of filter. We will take the pattern itself and then we will move through the whole image scan through the whole image to get the fuzzy locations initially. And then we will get the exact locations by IOU with SSI. Yeah.",4,3

That's interesting! Using OpenAI's API can indeed be quite powerful. Could you elaborate on how you transitioned from that to optimizing the chatbot's performance? Did you incorporate any specific techniques or technologies to reduce the latency?,"Yes, we did actually so after openai version was done. We transited to using this framework called Lang Syne for our purposes because of its highly Universal applicability and you know Basically the functionality that it provides so to towards the latency specifically what we did to reduce. The latency was one we opted towards a streaming facility to the output rather than waiting for the whole answer to get to us before sending it to the output. So we directly streamed the answer from open AIS servers to the output of the chatbot directly. So that reduced the latency by a lot second thing we did to reduce the latency was we hosted our own, you know, Azure server for charging PT which in turn, you know handles only our traffic other than the whole, you know. And that reduced the latency quite a bit that helped the latency quite a bit. So in a total, you know optimization the latency got reduced from around 3242 of the answer to around, you know, three to four seconds for the first.",2,3

We need to build an additional layer. So I kind of built an additional layer wherein irrespective of for the model's responses. I will check at the front end and also make sure I send the all these information to the backend a problem will can store the surgeon start time and change in time and whenever fallback action happens, you know, it kind of increases the count of the fallback action. We store all this information in the database and so that you know will be able to calculate all these metrics we can build a simple dashboard, you know with the steam returned all with this data from the database and you know will be able to find the analytics of these things.

"Great! Let's dive into the case study. Imagine you are working for a company that manages a large network of solar farms. Your task is to develop an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to detect and predict maintenance issues in solar panels, leveraging your expertise in machine learning and cloud technologies. The goal is to reduce manual inspection efforts and improve the efficiency of the maintenance process. To start, can you propose a high-level solution architecture or approach to tackle this problem?","Okay. So the first thing okay. It's kind of exactly problem statement that we are trying to solve. So the first thing is we have a dedicated field team, which basically, flies the drone and get all the images. Once we get all the images of the solar power plant, we particularly use thermal images. Once we get all thermal images of the solar power plant, we take that up. We process them. So, basically, processing means we use photogrammetry to generate the complete view of this, solar power plant. And once we have the complete view of the solar power plant, we based on our historical data that we had we initially had and we had already manually processed it for this, detecting the solar issues, like, we will have bounding boxes corresponding to each ortho mosaic. What we'll do is we take this, orthos, and we take the their corresponding, detections. Bounding boxes, you can say. And then we create a chunk of all these, this complete auto, we take create a chunk of this and create an image dataset with corresponding bounding boxes. Once we have those bounding boxes, what we'll do is we select, more, different models. So model selection for object detection, we can use different models. Like, we can use R CNN, faster R CNN. And, then we have new single shot detection models like YOLO and so we can use those things. So which are the latest is YOLO where it's that's why we proceeded to the yellow beard. And, after that, once we get the dataset prepared and we have preprocessed images like like I had said. We don't want a lot of noise that's why we converted it to grayscale images. And we have also used Wallace filter to make sure the contrast is in. And, oh, yeah. One more thing. So when we do fly or drawn itself, we need something named as, GSD. So GSD is the distance, global sampling distance. So what it means is that, how much meters a single pixel represents. So we have normalized that GSD also so that, model find its e find it easier to map those pixels, and there is not too much of a a difference among the autos even though the capturing process capturing of image process was different or something, you could say, and not the at the same GST. Okay. So once we have trained the model, what we can do is, we can evaluate the model based on whatever previous methods that we had for detection. Marking the solar issues. And, we can compare its performance with our model. And once we see that the the, of model performs better than what we previously had, We can simply put that model into production.",5,3

"Great! I see from your resume that you have a strong background in blockchain development, particularly with Ethereum and Polygon. Can you tell me about a specific project where you utilized Solidity and how you ensured the security of the smart contracts you developed?","Yeah, yeah, so I developed a blockchain a smart contract basically wherein iOS the requirement was to build a decentralized library management system. So in a library management system what we what we have in a regular college or schools. It's like we have a library in as the admin and we have the users as the students of the college College areas. So in that way so we have this so there are mainly few actions that can be performed by a user that are borrowing book returning book and paying for penalty. If there is a gap between the actual date of submission and propose date of submission. Then there will be a penalty. So for that there will be a penalty kind of thing or let's submission kind of thing. Let's submission. Also, there will be something like if if there is a book and that has a limited number of stocks then it can be distributed to particular number of people's so we also need to keep track of the stocks. So the stock of particular book so for that we also had the stock of the particular book and all those situation. We used a particular you you ID as the user ID. So user ID is tagged with the The users or here in case we can say that each of the library members. So like let's say here. It is a school students or college students. In that case we have this individual users. So we assigned you you ID also for for a safety reasons, we maintained that the admin can only actually Grant the permission of borrowing up borrowing a book which is in which is in the in actually in in the in the library and it is actually having the correct number of quantities. The quantities should be perfect so that the librarian can actually land that book to the students. So this this constant we actually measured or weak. We actually keep track of this constraint we using a map. So map in solidity is actually considered as the way of keeping a particular mapping is like here we use Aries. So here we actually you tagged a particular book ID with its quantity and when we are actually lending a book to a particular student, we actually deducting the unquote for deducting the availability of the that particular book so this all together also there were some kind of authority author authorization features in my application wherein the admin can only access the access at the access and Grant the permissions to the to the issue the student the books. Yeah, that's all over the idea. And here there I used a basically basically the library management uses the smart contract. Yeah, that's all.",2,3
"Understood, it's clear that your experience with C++ has been more focused on competitive programming where performance is key. Given your background in competitive programming, how do you approach writing efficient algorithms in C++? Can you give an example of a time when you had to optimize a solution for a particularly challenging problem, and what techniques or data structures you employed to achieve that?","Uh, yeah, so there are lots of times when and when there is a question in computer programming where the time limit is only one second and the N value is expected and value is like 10 to the power 6. So which expects us to write up optimal code in when I'm complexity but some but the most easy easy course like the boot Force One which comes to our mind which cost two Loops or one Loop one Loop and one binary search approach. So most of the times what we do is like in easier problems, these things can be tackled with using map algorithms like map helps us reduce. Oh and square it and completely problems to Owen and also binary research helps us to improve that like n Square time to unlock in. And they are different different data structures like priority queue. So in if we use that then the time complexity can be reduced. Like there was one one problem where we have to we have to Optimize the transactions between lots of land like a friend. It takes money from BCD and there are lots of transaction between all of them and we have to optimize the minimum number of transaction to settle all the bills between each of the friends. So if we write a Brute Force approach, it will require one square time complexity. So it will not pass in only one second. So if we can what have done is I have optimized and used to Priority use for that one of them including all the friends which have a positive value like they are they are old and the other you contain all of the persons who people and then I keep popping that the highest value from both of them and settling then and like if one one host 100 dollar and the second person is old minus 120 dollars and 100 dollars will be settled and that was 120 dollar bill have printed Dollar in deficit and it will again Go into the priority. So by this approach. I reduce the algorithm from n Square to end login. First you was in login.",3,2

Additionally, for the binary search implementation, how did you handle scenarios where a user or device had complex or hierarchical permissions that weren't easily captured in a simple access control list?","Yeah, I use a hash algorithm and the binary order them and this in this function and this will be a very important to us to be used in this function. Yeah. You bring up a great point about engineering the intelligence of hash values and handling complexity permissions in the binary search implementation to address this integration of has values. We implemented a technique called as a settling this involves this involves adding a unique and random values knowing has a salt to each user password before hashing it by using a different salts for each user. We a huge that even if two use even if two users had the same password, even if the two users have the same password there has value use you'd be difficult the addressing an external layer of a security and preventing the positions of a password guessing attacks regarding regarding complex complexity permissions. We design our binary search implementation to support a more flexibility Access Control structure in stead of a replying in instead of a replying on a simple Access Control list of utilize their highest approach. This mean this means that uses are a or a this means the uses are a devices where a signed assigned the roles which specific set of permissions. This role could be organized hierarchically allowing for more fine grain control or permissions by implementing a higher your handles ever scenarios, which uses or devices has complex permissions each role could have its own set of permissions and uses could be assigned multiple roles if needed this silver is allows us to capture complex permissions requirements by still utilizing the effects of binary search of Access Control. I hope the clarification. I hope the clarification how we ensure has values integrity and handle complex permissions within our within our access control system that mean if you Have any further questions or if if there anything else you like to discuss?",2,3
"Thank you for sharing those experiences. It's clear that you've tackled complex problems across a range of domains. Given your extensive work in computer vision, can you discuss a specific instance where you had to optimize a model for better performance, perhaps in terms of speed or accuracy, and what strategies you employed to achieve that?","Okay. Okay. So in that particular scenario, so we'll take about the sizzle project in which I have applied computer vision. So there was a challenge like okay if someone is shooting someone and there is a gun and in that particular those games, so we annotate those frames. So there were annotators who were annotating. I was involved in moreover the model development and Improvement of due to the hyper parameters and other things so the framework was a tensorflow and the model we were using was resonate 18 reset 50. We tried with different model Inception version 3. Also we have tried that time so majorly the model was revolving around resnet 18 doesn't 50 and Inception version 3. So in that particular scenario, there was a challenge like there are multiple there are not multiple frames of one single in instance because the inside instance of shooting someone suppose. I'm taking just an example suppose if someone is shooting someone in that particular scenario, there will be not multiple frames you will get to annotate so in that particular, If there is a scenario that if you don't have data if much data to train a model that I in that particular scenario, I have applied the argumentation techniques documentation technique was a little bit constrained. So we have applied like in the contract rightness rotation zooming and other prospective to give an idea. Okay, this particular instance will look something like this and this particular instance will look something like this. So I applied different documentation technique. And there is a Dropout layer as well in that that particular training model in which diffuses which basically multiple neurons to learn from each other so that the model should not be biased towards any of the particular class. Basically if you can say because in object or that is a classification plus detection, right? So so that should not be biased so I I have cartoons some of the hyper parameters as well like those hyper parameter first. I applied some argumentation techniques which improve my accuracy from originally the accuracy was like 72 to 72% when I have applied documentation techniques logically, like different different scenarios. There are in build argumentation technique. So in Python and tensorflow now Keras is also part of tensorflow. So in that particular scenario, I have applied documentation technique then a regularization technique in which Dropout layer was a scenario where I have used a Dropout layer. and in the final stage at the time of detection, right? So for optimizing that thing I have also like change some of the hyper parameters inside the tensorflow model which gave me an accuracy of around like 189 to 90% of accuracy and they were some few other things like adding some of the more images for that particular instance. Our accuracy at that particular season was 97.98 % accurate of a model was because we were Add argument and we are keeping our and making our data set very stronger over the times like slowly slowly over the time. We have multiple data set and from those data sets if the data set has been improved and because we are focusing again three to four games right there were not much of the incense is to be stored at our basically annotators. So from the increasing the data set also it helped me a lot and from the hyper parameter tuning like in Yolo. There is a have a parameter tuning to for the bounding boxes, which is generated as cross as right in the how you know works is like as process we divide the basically frames and the bounding box center point if the object lies in that in that particular scenario that bounding box is responsible to basically detect that particular object from from the image. So that particular thing also I have applied so hyper parameter tuning regularization technique like argumentation and Dropout layer help me to achieve almost like 95 to 97% of accuracy in season which was a good accuracy and over the time we we can figure out to increase more as well. But yeah, this was the whole particular thing, which I have done in any of this was the same thing, but there was bunch of 100 returns more annotators as comparison to season 2, we have much of the data and obviously the brand logos and other things should not will not change over the time like it will not change drastically right like suddenly.Over instances are very easy to pick up and why because as comparison to gaming because in gaming sometimes it happens like the instance will be a little bit changed and there will be a challenge if something is like little bit more change than it will be a challenge. But in in terms of logo detection it is not that much difficult and we calculate the pose estimation as well. And we tell in nanometer. We also tell the clients that okay, you can place your logo from here to here so that your brand visibility will be increasing because if you think in when a batsman is playing right in that particular position it he is in a like bend down position in which this particular logo will not be that much visible if it is in the chest and if it is it will be in the stomach then it will be more visible when a batsman is playing and if some player is playing at that particular point which particular section of the boundary in I'm taking up example of cricket in which particular section like situation is always hitting in this particular. Direction so what will happen is like for the other and that was a real-time detection in which God we suggested is true like at the end in the fencing there are brandings. Right? So if Rohit Sharma is having this this particular flow of playing in this particular direction, so we suggest Brands. Okay, you pay something more and real in the real time whenever there is a boundary you will get your visibility at that particular time. So we give that particular analysis also to them. So this is how I worked. Yeah in computer vision. And I know the Technologies. Hello. Hello.",4,3
"Handling noise in satellite images is indeed a common challenge. It's interesting that you leveraged both daytime and nighttime images. How did you preprocess the data to handle the noise and ensure that the model was robust to variations in illumination and cloud cover? Additionally, what kind of performance metrics did you use to evaluate the model's accuracy in different regions?","So if the not so we had a filter which would remove the noise density. So whenever the noise density level was above a particular threshold. This filter would remove the noise from the satellite image and then we would have An Adaptive weight algorithm, which would you know remove all the salt and pepper noise from the satellite image?",2,3
Great! I see from your resume that you've worked on an ESG Readiness Platform at Kanini Software Solutions. Can you tell me more about the role Azure played in this project and how you leveraged its services?,"Yeah, sure. So I worked there as a are Developer. I am still working on that. So it was a project name as a ESG reading this platform in which we need to minimize the effort of the auditor who is doing auditing on the various CSR reports and by using AI capabilities like engineer using lots of opening a models. We are doing some prompting to minimize to extract the information from the PDF as well as using some Azure services like Azure form recognizer and through that we extract the data from there and on which we find the contextual similarity of those texts and we just highlight it on the PDF wherever it meets the contextual similarities so that it is easier for the auditor to find a match and do the auditing so that the stakeholder can stakeholder can easily build a rapport. So that was the plot on a high level we can say",2,3
That's a solid choice for container orchestration. Using Kubernetes certainly helps in managing and scaling your application. Can you describe your experience with setting up a Kubernetes cluster and how you managed the deployment and scaling of your application within that cluster?,"So a final deployed my application container, but I have not scaled it to a huge level because it was my personal project.

Certainly. I was asking about your experience with model interpretability in machine learning and the techniques you've used to make complex models more interpretable. Could you share some insights on that?,"So model interpreter model interpretability or explainable AI as we call it is the degree in which a human can understand the cause of a decision made by the machine learning model. So there are many, you know methods to understand what made a model choose a particular action right like looker in local interpretable model agnostic explanations called as line. and this tells us. What influence these models to make one decision? So if there is too much bias in the data sometimes data can have a lot of bias which in which if passed down to the model and the model interns biased. Right. This is very much evident in a lot of language Corpus that we see these days most of the data sets which are available or even image data sets. They might have people from different races where One race is more predominantly, they're in a data set and that is seep down through the model and the generated content from this model beat in images or in language it would generate it would have this ratio by a sinner. So this is where model explainable AI really comes into which it",2,3

Can you walk me through how you approached the machine learning pipeline for detecting thermal issues in solar panels at SenseHawk, specifically focusing on the model selection and the reasoning behind choosing PyTorch Lightning as part of your tech stack?","Okay. So, starting from the beginning, So initially, they had a little bit scattered strip of retina net that they were trying to build a model on. But, the experimentation and hyperparameter during part was used to take a lot of time. So what we when I joined I streamlined the complete process. So, basically, I developed the this, complete end to end machine learning training pipeline. And the reason why I chose PyTorch Lightning was because at that so, training the model using Lightning was easier than using Vanilla PyTorch. We don't have to write, a complete loop for training and normalization. And optimize the other step. So we can directly use part of the function where we can easily define what should be what which optimizer to use, which loss to use, and those sort of things. And it will handle all the steps by itself. So that is one of the particular reason why we chose PyTorch Lightning. Another reason why we chose PyTorch was, at that particular time, there were a lot of, models that we wanted to experiment with. And they all were in PyTorch. So we had experimental TensorFlow, but, not as much And our main priority was to get into PyTorch. So that is one of the reasons. And, and, the another part about ML pipeline that, too, when we were building that, so we tracked everything, like, artifact metrics, cyber parameter using MLflow, And, the sub we had supported different models like, for retina net, and the YOLO v eight. And, what we did was, we wanted to compare the performance, so that's why we had logged all the models and all the experimentation part. Using ML.",4,3

And we can save those outputs. If the users are reporting that they are actually not happy with the answers provided or they are not happy with the actually the outputs of the model and once let's say like in a week if those instances where users have actually reported increase from a certain limit and we can go like development team can go through those prompts and see where actually the problem is existing and maybe Quick Fix apply any quick fixes or attaches into the prompt so that those problems are not repeated. And maintaining a database where the output generated by model do not align with human values and human are not happy.",2,3
"It's clear that you have a strong grasp on working with large language models and the various techniques for model optimization and training. The quantization approach you mentioned is particularly interesting for reducing memory usage without significant loss of accuracy. Given your experience with fine-tuning, could you elaborate on how you approach the process of fine-tuning a pre-trained model for a specific use case, and what kind of data or domain adaptation is typically required for your projects?","Yeah, great question. So let's talk about one fine tuning technique, which I am working currently. So there are a lot of different techniques which I did I can cover all of them if you if you are interested, but let's cover one technique which I did which is pretty you know unique in its own way and not people not usually people do that. So what we are trying to do is I'll try to give a domain knowledge what we are trying to I am working for a healthcare to make client where where he just not he wanted the model to not you know, give this medical names. Let's say there are a lot of medicines named Frozen and all so if a chatbot gives all these medication names it can be dangerous and it can so what what should the chatbots says if anyone asked these medical questions the chatbot should say that hey I can advise you, you know, what is the symptoms and conditions, but I cannot, you know advice. Any prescription prescription medicine you have to consult a doctor or some expert for this? So that's why this is the card rail, which we are trying to build in this chatbot. So we find tuned our model to learn this kind of question that if anyone asks, you know about these medicines and all our guardrail is going to get triggered such that it doesn't give the answer and it also gives the right advice to go to you know, the respected. Experts of this field who can give the right advice to the customer to the patient because a doctor can ask hundreds of questions. It understands the history of the of the patient and accordingly all these kind of criteria. It gives a prescribed medicine and we want the best for our patient. That's why we build this card and how did we build this guardrail is we use DP or technique? That's a direct difference optimization technique. How did we build the data set is for building this data sets. We need a question. We need to choose an answer. We need a rejected answer. So the loss function of this DPO is as such that we try to find the model such that the question and the chosen answer. The chosen answer has, you know, we try to increase the chosen answers preference increase the probability of that and decrease the rejected answers probability such that, you know, every time in the user Answer is always set by the this model. And this is how we try to you know, use a free trained model to find tune on top of a clinical data set domain. So and this is one thing let's talk about general, you know, fine tuning of General fine tuning is one instructing and another is you know continuation for fine tuning. So what is continuation and fine tuning in let's say our free training model is not expert in physics. What we can do is we can have lot of physical physics related Wikipedia articles or any articles research papers and all and we can feed it to our pre-trained model such that it can do the next word prediction and it can learn this domain of physics. That's how this is done and coming to the instructor fine tuning technique it that's where you know where the moral can learn to follow an instruction. Not only it understands the physics domain. So, you know understanding some Concepts and domain is one part and the second part is to also the chatbot has to follow the instructions given by the user. That's where instruct fine-tuning comes the data set over there. It looks like where we give the instruction we have a question and we also have an answer in this pattern. It will understand that. Hey there's a instruction and we have to follow that instruction. That's how you know the pre-training date. This is the data set for the instruction fine tuning works.",4,3

"Leveraging GPU acceleration both during training and inference, and optimizing the model for deployment on edge devices, is a strategic approach to balancing accuracy and speed.

"Utilizing the Mahalanobis distance and p-values for coherence testing is a sophisticated method. How did you determine the threshold for the p-value to establish the coherence of the data sources? Additionally, in the context of financial data, were there specific features or patterns you focused on to ensure that the synthetic data remained representative of the original data, especially in terms of its utility for training AI models?","So specifically we used heuristics from Finance such as a volatility surface Arbitrage check. So volatility surface must have arbitrage-free must be arbitrage-free. So we would have checks for calendar Arbitrage and Butterfly Arbitrage that we would check to make sure that our generative data was correctly. And coherently generated the p-values were done empirically so I would create inflated data that I knew for a fact did not come from the distribution and I would check to see whether or not it's just specific p-value was able to reject AKA x amount of the time and then I would permute the data either leave some in or take some out and recalculate the p-value to see if I would go back and get the exact same decision for that value. And in some summary we came up with 0.025, which is a lot stronger than 0.05 as a metric because data from Financial authorities are Financial distributions tend to be skewed.",4,3
Interesting choice with XGBoost for the final model. Can you elaborate on the features or data characteristics that led you to select XGBoost over the logistic regression model?,"Oh, yes, like the data set that I have taken it was from kaggle and the and the data was was converted into numerical values. All the data were converted into numerical values using PCA because of which it was a it was it was a little difficult to make the predictions based on those PCA values and that's why the accuracy for the logistic regression model was very less like below 60 as compared to the xgboost model.",2,3

"Great! Let's start with your project on developing a fraud transaction detection system using Tensorflow, Keras, and Jupyter Notebook. Can you explain the architecture of the model you used and why you chose it?","Yes, I have done this project approximately two months ago. We have done this project to detect the fraud transactions in a credit card for transaction data set where we used CNN algorithm to detect the fraud transactions. Here we acquired the data set and we have done some pre-processing like eliminating the null values and detecting the higher values and normalizing the whole data set into one standard form where the data is from ranges between minus 1 to 1 from that we have again taken the Matrix form of data set where we have placed one data set on the on the other data set and we have gained a matrix form. So this we are generated a pixel form where CNN Workshop? And from the we have detected the transactions which are fraud through some of the patterns and some of the methods whereas CNN news and we have designed our model in a such a process that data first goes goes into preferencing phase and then it gains in it comes into the normalized and standardized form from the model is created using CNN and we have some activation functions here and we have done a three layer neural network. A model and when data passes through these papers in layer, you and CNN eliminates all these negative values and null values. We have detected the transactions and we have gained an accuracy of 90% And we have done some other. Processes and updates to the model so that it again increases our accuracy and we at last we gained a crazy almost up to 90% So this is a about my project and architecture.",2,3

"Reducing the model from 16-bit floating point to 8-bit floating point through fixed-point quantization is a significant compression step. Given this change in precision, how did you address any potential issues with numerical stability or loss of information during the quantization process, especially considering the iterative nature of the stable diffusion model?","So, basically, because a kind of experimental work because, there were very few papers or very few people who are working on that domain to compress because everyone was mostly focused on improving the output of the stable diffusion model compared to compressing the model and bringing it to the device. But our target was to compress the model and bring it to the device. So we had to take up multiple approaches. Like, we tried to do it for 14.4, 14.8, and, for, half of the size of the weights in the encoder side, we tried to do it for 14.8 and maybe in the decoder side, we tried for 14.16 itself. So we tried experimentally multiple approaches. And the the one approach which helped us to give result closer to the original model was finally decided, and that was the one where, like, 14.8 was giving us best approach, and we used it. And, for mostly for optimization, we try to use the LoRa type of compression.",2,3
"Absolutely, please go ahead and complete your explanation of the second experiment. It's important to understand the full scope of your research and how it informed your approach to NLP challenges.","Thank you, very good. So my second experiment involved something called Mirror Vic. So that was a fine tuning technique, which is closely related to language modeling which forces the model to identify deeper meanings of words. Okay. So what we do is we you know, We actually Target a single word in a sentence to learn the deeper, meaning of then mask some random other words in the same sentence and then, you know try to get a word in context representation of the word or a word in context embedding of the word. So the embedding of the word but in that context, right so this concept I extended it to idioms. So I I replace idioms with a single, you know new token that I personally created. So because that's a research that shows that idioms are treated independently other than you know pieces, you know, idioms are handled as independent tokens rather than you know, aggregate of other words, right? That is how Transformers usually try to learn ads and that is how humans actually understand. And idioms also, so I first introduced a single token in place of the idiom and then try to learn the meaning of it through this mirror week technique. So in the where we technique what we did was I masked the idiom token. Okay, so I masked the idiom token. And then tried to learn the meaning of it through context. Okay, so if the idiom is used in if the idiomatic phase potentially idiomatic phrase is used in a non-literal sense, then the embedding of it would be very different than when the idiom is used in a literal sense. Right? So we find it for language modeling using contrastive learning described in the middle and we found that it really really helps in. Let's say magnifying the performance of bird or you know, extending or increase in the performance of bird towards understanding idioms. So that was a very interesting. Mind and it really did you know. Help increase the recognition of idioms in Transformer models. So first experiment was to understand how not Transformers actually treat idioms as a part of a task or as part of language then the second experiment was to try to improve the performance of the model towards understanding idioms. That concludes my project. And thank you.",5,4

So unlike we are like we have we also used like a kubernetes like where we created an instance of the deployed service so that once one whenever there is a like failure of pod so it can create a new pot and like new instance will be served. So there will be no latency in suffering of the application.

Where we can easily generate data into arrays and we can easily work on them apart from the partners. And we also killer and sci-fi. We can use statistical methods and other highly Advanced models through which we can easily manipulate the data and we can easily allocate the memory. locations and pandas is a From pandas we can easily process the data High complex data and allocate locations through it and we can easily manipulate and easily generate the new memory allocation story.,1,3
"Great! I see from your resume that you've completed a project called Gesture Detector using Python and OpenCV. Could you walk me through the process you followed to detect and recognize gestures, and how you handled the real-time aspect of this application?","Here so basically use a python Library known as media pipe, which is used in opencv. So what it does it detects some hand marks on your on your palm. So basically there are 21 hand marks. So if I will show you so the basically there are 21 hand marks on top starting from 0 to 21. So according to this the landmarks, we have created with functional dependency program, which will does this will be working on 2D coordinate system. So according to the coordinate system the all the letters of the English alphabet has been defined on the palm and if we do some proper signature there I have been working on American Sign Language. So that different sign language is for different letters. So we have input each of the letter and each of the coordinate for a specific letter and according to that in the Dynamically in live capture feed we are recognizing the letters as well as for more of the input process variable. So convert to take it to the next step and we have also tried to build a word former and according to that. We are facing screen on Life field and showing the letters and we can form the word.",3,2
"Understood, it sounds like you were able to manage the computational load within reasonable limits for that project. Let's shift focus to your experience with reinforcement learning. You mentioned extending the Sampled Policy Gradient algorithm for continuous control tasks. Can you walk me through the specific modifications you made to SPG and how these changes improved its performance or stability in your experiments?","Yes. So reinforcement learning is something that I love and I would like to keep talking about reinforcement learning in this particular interview. Number one SPG is a sampled policy gradient. So essentially how it works is In a really fpg is an actor critic, you know architecture. So at every instance when the actor has to choose a particular action in SPG, what we do is we sample actions by adding noise to The Chosen action. And then we see with the Q value of the chosen action and the sample action. And we compare which has a higher Q value and then we choose that particular action as our actors action and environment. This is the underlying of working of SVG. But the issue with SPG was when we have a continuous action space the you know, the number of actions that you need to choose from is very high. so when we are doing this the issue was SPG did not converge very well. So I explored I explored two things one as I proposed a new quantile truncated distribution reinforcement learning where we have a distributional learning curve that will help us in converging faster and quicker. However, this takes more computational resources.",4,3
"That's a very practical application of computer vision for real-time monitoring. Can you elaborate on how you handled the data preprocessing and feature extraction for the pose detection, and which machine learning or deep learning models you found most effective for this task?","Sure. So in order to perform the feature extraction, I basically used convolutional neural network. So for when I for in the convolutional neural networks, there is a convolution layer and there is a Max pooling layer which performs the task of feature extraction and feature enhancement after the task of feature extraction and feature enhancement. I've further train my model. are further in my model in the machine neural networks of convolutional neural network finally to achieve an accuracy of around 85%",2,3
"How do you approach the evaluation of model performance in terms of accuracy and latency, and what metrics do you prioritize to ensure that the system maintains a high level of accuracy while also meeting the latency requirements for real-time or near real-time applications?","It so the when evaluating mobile performance for real-time or near real-time applications. I adopt a comprehensive approach that considers both accuracy and latency Matrix. So like accuracy metrics were classification accuracy assessing the model's ability to correctly classify handwritten text inputs. Then whatever calculating the rate of errors in recognized words compared to the ground growth. Then character similar to the ear and CEO and similar to wscr calculates the rate of Heritage at correct level providing insights into the accurate of individual characters recognized by the system. Then latency metrics like inference time. It measures that I'm taking for the model to process a single input and produce the corresponding output and to end link and see evaluate the total time elapsed from when the user inputs and it didn't text to when the system generates the recognition result. Then we have analysis like aggregated of conduct. It conducted of analysis to balance accuracy and latency requirements based on the application needs and his performance Divinity evaluating the stability of Performance Marketing metrics across different input conditions. Like then we have there is device benchmarking testing the performance of handwritten text recognition system across the range of mobile devices with varying Hardware specification that was important, like people have different smartphones. So yeah. So by prioritizing accuracy and latency Matrix conducting trade-off analysis and bridging Benchmark and profiling techniques. I showed that the handwritten text recognition system maintains high performance and mobile devices while meeting the demands of real time on near real-time applications. Thank you.",3,2
"Implementing a threshold for unknown predictions to ensure transparency and reliability is a thoughtful approach. How do you envision further refining these zero-shot models and their prompts to handle more nuanced or complex classifications, perhaps in scenarios where the distinctions between classes are subtler?","Okay. That is based on attention mechanisms considered. A classification mode or all detection model it has to focus on the whole region. But what we do is we utilize custom based moral that is based on attention mechanisms that is utilizing cushion Transformers through which will focus only on the region of Interest. We don't focus on that the regions that is not correcting for the classes. So consider this classification model we need to relevance propagation through which will understand these particular features or very much important and that attention mechanisms will focus on that reason alone through which the understand this region is quite complex. And this is very important to capture. We add more weights to those Seasons through which the explainer or even the model since the Deep learning model can understand we should focus on this region that the usual model developed using deep learning through until you have a deep learning model with an accuracy 91% and Her model, that is based on attention mechanism. It is it will be slightly more than 7% Accuracy can be around 98 to 99% That is for sure for a classification model if it is a segmentation model, it will be around 3 to 4%",2,3
"Creating word clouds or similar visualizations can indeed be a helpful way to convey the most common words associated with positive and negative sentiment to end-users. For dimensionality reduction, did you also explore techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) or singular value decomposition (SVD), or did you use any other methods to reduce the number of features while retaining the most important information for the model?","Oh, no, it was a basic project for finding the sentiment analysis. So we did not in use any complex features like that.",1,2
"Data augmentation is indeed a powerful technique for addressing the limitations of a small dataset. Now, let's shift focus to your experience with PyTorch. Can you tell me about a specific project where you used PyTorch and what led you to choose PyTorch over other frameworks for that particular application?","I have always preferred pytorch, even though I start with tensorflow. I gradually went on to use Python for all of my projects. So majority projects are done in pytorch, including the medical image analysis with Pytorch in my segmentation pipeline stood up later on as you've done with pytorch my llm trainings and the other models that have done. So the research paper server worked on everything. They have implemented in pytorch. And the main reason that I levitated towards my torch is the amount of Freedom that it gives you Well tensorflow is very high level abstracted. It's very useful for people who are beginning to learn deep learning and that's great because they can just dive deeper into it, but I thought you will have to End up defining every single moment. Like for example, you are a kind of defining all the Lost calculated and after that you have to end up deciding dot step backward so you can calculate the loss and so on and I find this very useful because with this fundamentals I can end up creating whatever kind of Deep Web block I want and this gets me a lot of flexibility, even though there's a bit of learning curve. The second reason is the Frameworks. I very frequently use fast Ai and pytorch lightning in my research project, especially when I'm at a model. This is allows me for quick iteration quick training quick ideation of thoughts. So this makes me very efficient in that manner.",4,3
"Interesting approach. Which machine learning algorithm did you find most effective for sentiment analysis in your project, and why?","s v, svm, and, s like, SVM decision tree. I found, I found SVM very effective for sentiment analysis because after performing lots of, like, we performed training on different models like SVM, and there were few more, but we found that SVM was giving best results So upon discussion with our professor, it was found that initially you cannot be very sure of what model based on the structure will give you best results. This will technically come up after your result when you observe the results. So after observation, we made conclusion that as VMS performed best.",2,3
"Refreshing user queries based on context is a smart way to enhance the relevance of search results. How do you handle the computational overhead of this query refreshing process, especially in real-time applications?","So inquiry reference, we query phrasing first, we after getting the document and convert into Vector DP we first get the summary of that particular document. So it will give around three to four lines and we have to write a prompt. It's prompt engineering work. We have to refresh we have to provide like refresh this particular question based upon the documents summary and it will refresh according to that.",1,2
"Understood, let's continue. Could you explain the approach you took to implement Continuous Training Pipeline Architecture for AI models at Phenom? Specifically, how did you manage model versioning, data drift, and concept drift in this pipeline?","So basically what we try to do is we try to Leverage The AWS tools like Crossing job training job and it's just like we created a pipeline where we try to fetch the data from different we create the logic for it and create from that. We just make the code with the logic and create an ECR Docker image out of it. So for the crossing as well as the training job, so what we will do is whenever we see there is any issue like drift happened basically, like if there is any features drift happen, we use like statistical test like kale Divergence test. So this helps us to find the drift which happened in each of the feature. So if the number of features were high, Drift happened so we can say there is a data trip happened. Similarly. There is a more we try to find the metric often East Batcher and the metric is been declining for some particular batches. We can say like a model drift has happened. So if anyone of the drift happened what will lose you'll try to trigger this continuous training pipeline where already we have our courts ready, right Crossing job and training job. So we use this AWS processing up by triggering using this Docker image. So once the processing job is completed then we will just trigger the training job. So this training job. What it will do is it will try to take the model which was locked in the ml flow. So and it will load the model and just fine tune it with this new data, which came from the production. Once we find you need right? We'll just again do this validation on some of the new production data, which is not used for the training and we just check the production model as well as the newly trained model and will decide based on the metric. So if you are currently trained model metric is better, what will do is we will just log this model in mlflow and register it with the newer version. So this is how exactly the city pipe Print Works",4,3
"Using TF-IDF and Word2Vec for vectorization is a strong approach to feature engineering in NLP tasks. When you applied TF-IDF and Word2Vec, how did you balance the interpretability of the model with the complexity of the features? Additionally, how did you handle the challenge of dimensionality reduction, which can become significant when working with a large number of unique words in a corpus?","oh, yeah, so in that case we had to remove the Stopwatch that solved the most of the case data and data length, so that's that's so we reduced the multi the dimensionality reduction issue. And other than that. The question was about TF IDF, right? So TF IDF was hmm. Sorry, can you repeat the question about your video?",1,2
"It sounds like you've made a thoughtful choice with the TF-IDF vectorizer and lemmatization for text preprocessing, and the use of a random forest classifier for its interpretability and feature importance analysis.

Can you elaborate on the specific challenges you've faced with this project and how you've addressed them?,"Yeah, there was a lot of challenges we faced in this project. The first thing is I was I joined there as a software development in turn so they are the most challenge there for me as I mean the challenge which I faced there was. Addressing the issues which are technical stuff. The thing is that whenever you are dealing with a project or whenever you as a software developer whenever building a particular project or working on a particular application. It is a very important to optimize everything. However, I have seen that very even technically sound projects just gone for a failure. So one of their could be many reasons now one thing for a succession failure of a project is not just technical background or the technical details of the how much optimal it is, but also the sales that are several other factors even the time in the fans and everything determines of failure of the project. So there this Moto came into myself that okay, not only the technical stuff will matter but also on the sales the sales side the marketing side and the timing and what the customers need realizing the customers this all of these things Club to gather to determine the succession failure of a projects. This has been one of the major challenges. As we spent a lot of time on the exploration and understanding what the people need or whatever people seek so that the product that the company releases on some good profit and the first trade kpi key performance index that increases. So this is one of the main challenges we face in Super Bowl developing the co-pilot.",1,2
"Using a rigorous methodology and setting benchmarks for model performance is crucial, especially with large language models. When you mention benchmarking the model's performance on unseen messages and context identification, what specific metrics or evaluation techniques did you use to quantify the model's success, and how did you iterate on the model to improve its performance over time?","F1 score is one Matrix that I kind of used to check whether it is actually a performing really well or not. Because you know that way you'll be able to see like how many of the dungeon invisible classified correctly and how many of the scene misses were classified character. So it kind of balances both. So that was one of the inch marks that I kind of used. And recall Precision is also the parameters. But yeah, I mean a fun school is kind of you know calculated from this region and recall.

"NutriSuggest sounds like a groundbreaking project, especially in its approach to personalized healthcare solutions. Given the complexity of managing user input, how do you ensure the machine learning model's recommendations remain accurate and relevant, and what role does data validation play in this process?","The machine learning plays an important role data validation display an important role because the user input actually users. We expect the users to give their diet plan their history of medical treatment. Let's say it's been treated by any diagnosis. Let's say they had a surgery before that hypothyroid situation. So the user needs to input into different categories. They can keep adding categories in the below of what kind of communications they have and what symptoms they are actually facing so using the symptoms and using this health conditions, which they have already recognized. They can be some symptoms which they don't know and they can be some symptoms which are actually triggering to a new health condition. So which this all together should be able to patent the data set. We have the data set we have collected which is currently static but we can make it Dynamic using by constantly updating it the data set. So using the static data set we have because this is kind of we are able to match the health condition. Let's say thyroid and the ages above 60 years and let's say he's been searched. He's been operated before with a heart surgery. So the diet plan the machine learning should be able to match the pattern of taking this input and searching the list in such a way that data set with like, let's say I'm suggesting youOkay, so many seeds or I'm suggesting you Asgard juice for hypothyroid or let's say for acidity. So I put thyroid for Asgard juice. The machine learning should be able to map it to the infuser input. But what happens is I've got to be 10 cause stomach pain for elderly people. So the machine learning should also filter this and not not give Asgard as their diet in the whatever plan of action what if the deed the application is providing user value the form valid like the application validation or the form validation important role because It is important. We get a valid and reliable information from the user and it is important that the information is enough. To actually map it to the health condition of the diet plan. We cannot give a random or an ambiguous deck plan which can create more health problem to the user. It should be sure and the diet plan will be giving when the machine learning pattern is satisfied with the user input and is able to actually dynamically change the diet plan according to what user has provided. So this is what we are trying to create and it can get better and better with time is what if",2,3

So I have I have found a pubg data set online and I have a domain knowledge in the specific game too. I know how the parameters work and the parameters where the you know, the basic game related mattresses and match outcomes like the weapons used the Number of players in the game the teams number of teams and the total distance traveled number of cares those kind of parameters. Were there including categorical features for Android phones. I Process pre-process the data I checked for missing values and anomalies because since I have the domain knowledge in the specific field, I know what is possible and what is not possible. So I have checked for the you know, identification of bots. So people play with bots. So I have checked because if the person is not moving, but they are killed rate. Which is the country that means yeah, they brought so that those columns need a clean and representative to get a good predicting model. And then I have subject to the data set through scaling and normalizing and then feature engineering I did with as I said handling anomalies and normalizing, you know, in some matches there are like 100 players and the number of kills will be 20 and there are matches where there are 20 players and the number of kills or 20. So the second scenario has more weightage than the first one so that should not be neglect negligible. Right? So I have included a normalization parameter in it and which ensured that all the features and trolls gets enough importance and also have dead. Hyper parameter to tuning in the models that I have mentioned in my resume, like, you know cat Bowl cat boost and random Forest. I have did hyper parameter tuning including grid search and first I have implemented in random way and but I did not get the good optimized results.

But according to the data only we can do for example in some scenarios. We might need to write a query where we need to get the means for example, average salary of a people in a company. So in that case what we can do so there might be multiple fielders. For example, we need to take where company name equals to so and so and the employees may be the job role will be something and we need to find the average salary for the particular job role in the same company. So that that is how we have used SQL queries. So even in our project also we have done the same thing, so, If there is something happening we need to do this analysis based on the data set. So it is not like a generic cases. But according to the data we can write the queries. So I am good at SQL queries rating. Yeah.",2,3

So basically for feature extraction purposes in my model random forest was used for the classification purposes for the feature extraction TF. IDF. Vectorizer was used what TF IDF vectorizer does is that it takes the input data in the form of text. It assigns a numerical weight to each and every value in that article. It depends upon the frequency of that are word in that article multiplied by the uniqueness of that word among all the Articles. So this is how TF IDF Vector is a science weight to each and every word in the article.

So yeah coming to your question the model size and training right? So model size as you said, you know this these are large language models and these models are pretty large. Let's say we have Falcon we have Mr. We have mixture now and now there are a lot of 70b models. So the model size is determined by the the parameter the parameters how many parameters the model has so there are seven billion model. There are 35 billion parameter models and they are 70 billion parameter models also. So we were in Middle where we were trying to do the 13th parameter model of llama. So we were using this. Kind of model and yeah, this is these are pretty large and how do we do it? How do we store in our own GPU is we do the quantization technique where we tried to sew one Precision is 32 bit float. What we did is we quantize this model to 4 bit so that we can reduce the memory for that large language model and try to optimize it and even though if we reduce these many Precision points, the accuracy was almost as far as the full precision. So we didn't also lose accuracy. Maybe there is a 0.1% of accuracy decreased but that really doesn't much matter because we wanted much more speeder and lighter kind of a model. That's how we deal with all these things and coming to training training these large language model. There are different accepts of there are a lot of different, you know ways to do it one is parameter efficient tuning test. There is Laura where we use Laura then there is Q Laura then there is I am also doing this there is supervised fine-tuning and there is also this DPO which is direct preference optimization. I have done a lot of a lot of These Fine tunings and trainings on top of it. So there are a lot of free training so which we use but we didn't pre-train the whole model because these models take a lot of time to train. So what we did is we try to take the already pre-trained model and we find tuned on top on top of it for our custom use case. So that's what we did.",5,3
"That's a thoughtful approach to leveraging both Java and Python based on their strengths. Now, let's talk about SQL. Can you discuss how you've used SQL in the context of machine learning projects, perhaps for data retrieval, cleaning, or preprocessing? How do you ensure the queries you write are optimized for performance?","Okay, we have used the SQL in one of the machine learning projects where we were working with the rainfall detection and prediction on an Australian weather data set in one of my internships where the use case is like we have a entire data which can be getting from that database and that can be trying to our custom machine learning algorithm or a model for that purpose to retrieve the data effectively. We have used the SQL queries to get the data to our current ID or the system platform right where we are developing this models for that purpose. We have used the SQL for it and to make ensure the sequel queries where optimized we have a separate framework developed within our organization, which will validate the sequel queries based on the primary keys and foreign Keys as well as some of the Terminologies with respect to the sequel and no sequel databases that framework. We have used it which will Auto detect the primary keys and foreign keys and specific conditions within the database with respect to the schema of the database and that will convert our queries to in a better way so that we can retrieve the data effectively and also we can push and pull and modify the data with the database so that life we got the data efficiently. and the monitoring not not the monitoring exactly and maintaining this machine learning model. Within the machine learning operations is pretty much easy with this capability what we used.",2,3
"Interesting approach to balancing the dataset. Moving on to your inflation rate prediction model, could you elaborate on how you parallelized the model's computations and what specific deep learning techniques you employed to enhance its predictive accuracy?",Yes inflation rate was a BNA hectic problem. For most of the countries here in relation rate. Mostly depends on data like GDP wages and imports exports and many more week. We cannot even easily underestimate the inflation of a country. So we have used many deep learning techniques and parallelism model to reduce the running time and to reduce the complexity here. We have used data for parallelization model where the data is generally divided into small parts and we have looped our model in almost 50 iterations and we saw that 50 data sets will be would be trained and we get an individual accuracy for each and every training data set. And at last we have used a assembly modeling where each and every accuracy is combined and resultant accuracies produced. It may explain about the architecture of my project here first. The data is gone through data preprocessing as as initially and it is generally Turned into the standardized form and then we have done a reprocessing method here. Our data gets divided and we have used gpus to do this in Google collab and later. Our model is generally designed to Simply allocate this data sets and we have we have again used back propagation where our hyper parameters are changed for each and every iteration through this each and every model each and every data set is trained against one model where by of copy of model and later. The accuracy is generated. So we got an accuracy greater than 90% And through graphs. We have credited the inflation rate of future one year of each and every country like us Nigeria Chile and Argentina and through this we have got a simple validation laws and I can say that it has worked very well and this is a better method to reduce the runtime and time complexity of a ml project. So we have even reduced the model complexity by not just using the model complex model Palace not just using the model palletization. So this is of my projects.,2,3
"It's clear that Python has been a significant part of your work, especially with PySpark and Airflow for orchestration. Given your experience with Java, how do you compare its use in building scalable systems to Python, and can you share an instance where you chose Java over Python for a specific requirement?","Yes, we have used a Java as well as python based on the use cases in my past project where we developed a cloud-based ETL tool. The primary data injection the trader transformation and execution of the badge jobs were returned in Python because like because of the application seems to be simple and that very much. Robustness for that reasons. We have choose a python for that. But when it comes to the testing and data parity checks the data parity check in the sense like the weather the pipeline work fine or not and also the data correctness and data validity checks were written in Java. We have choose a Java for that specific use case just because like it is very much useful in terms of having it multiple classes and object oriented programming. Which gave us a proper abstraction over the data? and also the inheritance And calling in between the classes this very much useful and can be implemented better in Java rather than python. So for this data quality and validation checks and also for the testing of our framework, we have returned the code in Java for that use case and the rest of the things based on Simplicity and Readiness of the spark framework with a python we have chosen python for that transformation and injections.",4,3
Incorporating incremental learning is a sophisticated way to ensure model adaptability and accuracy over time. How did you manage the computational overhead associated with incremental learning to keep the system responsive?,So my data set was not that big. So if your data set is Big you might need. Rich computational resources to perform model training my data set was comparatively smaller. So I trained my model in my local device.,1,2
"Using KNN imputation for age and median imputation for blood pressure is a thoughtful strategy. Shifting focus a bit, I'm interested in the 3D Tropospheric Aerosol-classification model, CALMAC, that you've developed. Could you explain the key features or parameters that differentiate CALMAC from traditional 2D classification models, and how these influenced the model's accuracy and computational complexity?","Okay, so calm back is basically it is a research paper that I published into the item B, I guess and what it does is usually for any meteorological data. There is a system of planarity, right you look at the play and all the data Falls within that plane, but for us I have various height levels in which aerosols are concentrated and I want to see that exactly which height what's the percentage? That was my key problem? So what I did was I used a multi output caution regressor so that for each layer, which means like I said single Clarity right can't take 3D as multiple plenaries. So for each play, I'll use a single input and created a multi output caution that results so that I could create the",2,3
"Your insight into Matplotlib and Seaborn's relationship is spot on. Given your extensive use of Matplotlib, could you discuss a more complex visualization you've created, perhaps one that involved multiple subplots with different data comparisons or a heavily annotated chart to convey nuanced information? And with Seaborn, which excels in statistical data visualization, have you leveraged its specialized functions for statistical estimation within your projects?","The matplot library I've used it for correlation Matrix in one of the tasks. I was working on I feel to say it had 81 columns around 81 features. I mean to check the correlation Matrix for that kind of data surely matplotlib was the option for plotting the correlation Matrix so annotations and all those defining all those things we get color which has the highly core related value for the column. So in this time at plot library was most commonly used for plotting such correlation metrics in my project as I use and see bone library is for multiple plots plot any kind of plot since it gives the annotations or mean to say it will give the value on it. So it was a best method to perform exploratory data analysis, like uni variate multivariate by variate analysis on the given data. So this this is the way I used not to live on.",2,3
"That's a very strategic approach to task allocation, leveraging the individual strengths of your team members. It's clear that you value understanding the capabilities of your team to ensure the right fit for each task. Now, considering your technical skills, particularly in Python and SQL, can you describe a situation where you had to optimize a SQL query within a Python application, and what specific techniques or tools you used to improve its performance?","Yeah, so for that I have build quite a basic project when I was in first or second year so which was about creating one attendance system with respect to python. So what it did is with facial recognition, we can capture the face of the person and that face ID. There will be a face ID when the face is captured of the user that face ID will be stored with the mySQL database and that SQL will have no duplicate values that will be answered by the programming itself. And yeah according to that the attendance system has been taken. So this was kind of basic part. So I integrated the my secret with python using DB connector my security be connected and I thought to move it forward a bit. But yeah, I think it was kind of stagnant part where I reached a saturation that cannot be more developments if I'm capturing the faces with respect to Media Piper any of the facial recognition model. So it what it does is it captures the face points and each face for each face will have different different points and each different points will be categorized into vector and that Vector value will give him a number assigned a number and that number is a store in the master security.",2,3
"That's insightful. Given your experience with different models, what specific techniques did you employ to address the challenges of overfitting or underfitting in your machine learning models, especially in the context of the traffic violation detection project?","Oh. Since we collected the data from multiple sources, we did not have such overfitting or underfitting cases. We had given the equal amount of samples for model creation. So that's how we come up with a good accuracy level.",1,3
"Configuring Spring Security with the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter is a fundamental step in securing Java applications. You've mentioned using an in-memory user store with default credentials.

"Certainly. In a scenario where you're capturing multiple faces in a live feed for an attendance system, how do you ensure data integrity and consistency in your MySQL database when dealing with concurrent transactions, such as multiple face captures happening at the same time?","So yeah, so this was kind of also an issue where the data integration vital part for the programming purpose. So what I did is I encrypted I also try to encrypted the value in crypto programming part where the SQL database is hidden from the user or from the any of the management part where the management cannot see or cannot have the access to the part where the my security database is accessed. Only a root user will be have the access for the database parts. So the data Integrity is very that issues solved because if I create that open program for all then it will create and kind of hustle. It will create a kind of a wrestler or an issue where the privacy of the users are also hampered. That's why it was a it was kind of necessary to do this because there have been multiple if there are multiple faces in one frame then it is kind of difficult for the machine has to directly recognize each one of them and if it if we want to do so, it requires a very high compute power as well. So at that moment Master System was not compatible for such kind of things. But yeah, I'll try to build it more.",1,2
"Now, regarding the security aspect, how did you implement security measures in your campus delivery application? Could you elaborate on any specific Django security features or practices you employed to protect user data, especially considering the sensitive nature of transactional and location data?","Okay. So all of the information that is stored all of the user information specifically is stored in an encrypted database. The encryption is done using the asset 64 method, which is inbuilt in Django. The SS 64 takes up a lot of space but that's why we use AWS services to host our services. Yes apart from that. No other features has been used but the payment details are flushed out every 10 minutes. So as to not keep any record of the user's details",1,4
"Logging artifacts and intermediate results for reproducibility is a solid approach. How do you handle the versioning of these artifacts and dependencies, especially in a dynamic environment where updates to libraries or frameworks could impact the reproducibility of your results?",Okay. So basically what we are doing is we are hosting our own mlflow Service mlflow as a service. So in mlflow what we do is we try to log artifacts for each of our run and it will be stored in our backend. So whenever we want we'll just load that particular artifact whenever you want to replicate so it's like just logged in some database kind of,2,3
I understand that the BLEU metric might be a bit technical to explain in detail. Could you walk me through the process you used to preprocess the data for your pseudocode to code generation project? What specific techniques or tools did you find most effective for this task?,"Where the most simplest tools that we used where? Centipede didn't have to change anything in this particular part. Each time we had a particular length of strings, which is ended up tokenizing them and we had a particular token for the master. We used for copying things. So we had a particular mask called copy token, which was basically something that was in the blanks kind of thing. Which we later used when we combined it with our copy tokens. So these simple tokenization we ended up using the default documentation provided by my torch and the events tokenizers for some elements as such but we ended up using some tokenizers very simple tokenizers. which will end up documenting them and we added a custom tokenizer, which is the copy tokenizer and for people crossing I think very simple things which we just removed the punctuation which just hello guest I think which is already the case, right? We just had to make sure that we do not remove any of the punctuations that's required in the you know semicolons and so on. A more interesting thing is that we made sure all the comments are there because the comments are good way to know what the code is about. But we had to remove the comments in the code. Which is generated because given a pseudocode we don't generate comments and then go that's a bit confusing. So what we ended up doing is in that particular context. We remove the comments from that. Code data that we had the target data so we didn't get to confused.",2,3
"That's a comprehensive pipeline, involving OCR, data chunking, and a retriever for question answering. Regarding the knowledge graph, how did you ensure the scalability and efficiency of the metadata storage for the entities and relations, especially when dealing with such a large volume of documents?",Here so storage was not an issue. So we use the neo4j graph database for storing the data and that helped us store that all the data and it was also useful for building a knowledge graph of the data so we can see like how the relations are entity are matching to each other.,2,4
"That's quite a versatile use of programming languages.

I have handled like it is a normal competitive programming where I will be having five questions and two hours Gap to solve all five questions. So most of them were of lead code challenges of medium and easy level so there were no I mean, Mostly challenges are faced in this competitive programming our because of logic like getting correct logic to solve that problem.

I was using a weather API. So I was using to fetch the data from that API. And then finally I my task was to deploy to show it on the website. So what I was doing is my first priority is whenever user loads a website, it isn't wait for the data to be loaded for at the first all the HTML CSL for CSS files should be displayed on the screen so that you know, it is not have to wait for complete website to load and then in the background those those apis or handled with the help of promises at each promise. I was getting the data from API and if there is any are I have catch that are at shown a proper error to the user and if it is fast properly then that proper data is so given in the console and and I kept one thing in my case while showing error. I updated its different parameters. Like what is a status of Aer what is the message inside the air? I have shown completed his and in this way. I have used promises because promises can have two values either fulfilled or reject and also so whenever promises resolved, I have a proper information in the console and if it is rejected its information is given the form of error is 4004 if it is paid or it is a 200 to put his okay.",2,3

Not only in machine learning but in terms of data Engineering also, we required to do that process the data cleaning can majorly happen with respect to the proper machine learning framework such as Keras and also we did some of the data cleaning and data processing with the tensorflow as well. Where the proper data cleaning can be happening? Where we eliminate the Redundant columns in the specific data set or the database while we were retrieving the data from it. And also we will normalize the data in such a way that like everything will be a suitable valid vectors when we were training the data to the models that is a proper technique. We were used in the data cleaning and the data preprocessing also will be happen with respect to the tool what we have told about that will oftenly use data argumentation techniques to clean the data and replicate the data for the better training.",2,3

I use it to plot. I mean different box plots bar plots or something like that. I will go with C1 Library.",1,2
I appreciate the insight into how you've optimized deep learning models for performance. Could you now explain the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning and provide an example of a problem that each type of learning is well-suited for?,"Yeah, sure. So basically supervised learning is the part of machine learning where you have your features and you also have labels and you sort of have to divide them according to your labels. So for an example of this could be in classification problem. You could have features suppose. We have to suppose the labels are if a patient has cancer or not and the features could be something like the pressures. Sorry the patients pressure blood pressure something like some other medical features. So that would be a classification problem that will be supervised learning in unsupervised learning. You don't have you don't really have labels you just have data you just have features and the Target in supervised learning is to sort of make groups of these data boards. We can do them using clustering algorithms. So for example, you just have some data of some people with their High weight some other features and using clustering or unsupervised learning models you can make groups of these people using some sort of metric So that is how supervised learning and unsupervised learning are in machine learning.",2,3

It's interesting to hear about your transition from GCP to Azure and the evolving landscape of Azure services. How do you stay updated with these rapid advancements to ensure you're leveraging the latest features effectively in your projects?,"This is one of the most important for developers because every single day something or the other is changing and you need to keep yourself updated. Now. One of the ways is that you refer to the documentation every single time because I think that documentation is the only source of thing where everything is complete instead of going for the tutorials or other resources or other articles of using a thing a documentation is always more valuable than all of this whenever a company releases something it always attach a documentation. In fact, every good company does that is a very good practice. Very good industrial practice. So I always refer to documentation and I try to find the things that I actually need and Implement that and one more most important thing. Why refer to the documentation is the resource there is complete and if the company releases some new features that will be differently during the documentation. But if you're following some other resources, there is high chance that might not be there. So documentation is the what can I say the gold resource? for a developer",2,3
"Referring to research papers and leveraging OpenAI's platform for an efficient yet cost-effective embedding model is a strategic move. How did you evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the chosen embedding model, perhaps in terms of its ability to capture semantic nuances present in GST-related content and user queries?","oh, yes, the two increase the efficiency of the model. I had to first train the model on a training data set like after doing the pre-processing on the data and then After pre-processing the data like after after removing the words that were not relevant after. And then the feature then there was feature engineering on those on those data and after training the data I used to. To choose testing the data.

When you're comparing models and making adjustments, how do you manage the trade-off between precision and recall, especially in a conversational AI context where user experience is key? Can you give an example of a decision you made to favor one metric over the other and the rationale behind it?","Ah, definitely sure and precision and recall like they're really equal important. So that's why you know, I kind of took the one score but again ultimately depends upon the application that you are actually working on. For example, if I take in the healthcare industry, they're like, you know, the recall was kind of very important and for example, in other industry equal was not so important, right? So for example is not so important even if you make some wrong decision, that's fight okay, but in case of like, you know healthcare industry where like every day or point was quite important to her and for the diagnosis and all, you know, it's really important for you to know make sure that you're doing correctly. So obviously whatever happens, you know, depends upon the domain as industry that you are actually working. So I kind of you know, depending upon industry. I yeah, I agree to certain point that I kind of give importance to you know, one factor compared to the other Factor, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't vary that much. So on a overall when you see the overall picture the performance is good. The user experience has to be good and how frustrated the user was like when you are doing the commissioner. You also need to make sure that You know your user is not frustrated and see if there are any fallback actions how many of those fallback actions are happening? You have to see like the drop-down score and the second time all those things right? So these were some parameters additional sample additional parameters that I will see what was the ideal session length how much the average person was? Well, there was any outliers or not. So all these parameters will come and pick into the picture for conversation AI.",2,3

With the transition to semantic search and the integration of BERT for contextual understanding, how do you measure and ensure the accuracy of the search results, especially with the dynamic nature of user queries and content updates?","Up. So yeah, that's a good question. So again, we are using the MTV benchmarks that that are posted on the hugging face as our base understanding of Which models are doing better. Another thing that we have is we have a team a relevant C testing basically here. So we have this our own benchmarking system. Number one is manual, right? So we asked 10 or 15 users who are using the search. So just go through some queries and see how the results are coming and how the results are looking. That's number one second. We have again our road benchmarking system. We have this inbuilt in not inbuilt. We have our custom make algorithm which which we use on some customers data we have their Expected documents in Withers and the like expecting documents for these queries basically the top search results like that. So they have provided us this with so we test our hypothesis on it. And when we are showed like this could work and only then we are roll out the future.",3,2
Involving user feedback for model performance evaluation is a great strategy. How about the model's ability to adapt and learn from new data or user interactions?

And for the digit recognition task, I used convolutional neural network, CNN, is a deep learning algorithm that works well with image data Specifically, I use the Keras frame framework to build the CNN model. And there are some challenges like, the biggest challenge in this project was to identifying the best CNN architecture and hyperparameters to achieve high accuracy in digit recognition. Additionally, preprocessing the data to remove noise and ensure uniformity across different images was also challenges. And during the project, I gained a deeper understanding of deep learning algorithm, specifically CNN. And how they can use, to solve image recognition tasks. I learned how to preprocess image data for training and testing and how to tune parameters, hyperparameters, to optimize model performance and how to evaluate model accuracy.

And like we have I have also checked the Precision and recall of the model so both were like, it's a nearly 80 to 90% And then there is one more there is other two metrics, which is kind of considered in Yolo model. So even those those are all those four metrics were like looks good. So that is one like we have after a post inference of the model like we have a motive to the Productions.",1,2

There was like it is a Time series signal which with voltage right? So basically I have to deal with that. And also, please let me tell you our aim of the project was to identify and detect drones with the help of RF signals. So basically what I did was the time series signal is very long, right and for doing AI work these much of data will require so much complexity. So therefore what I did is I used RF signals that convert them converted into a crosswave spectrums which are like images which Define the relationship between the RF signals time series and frequency domain signals. So it converts the RF signal into images and then I have used the convolutional neural network. To classify the images or detect or classified different type of Thrones with respect to those images.",2,3

It was movie a movie analysis like the movies and movie sentiment analysis and prediction it involved python with data science skills that is data analysis data visualization and through the through those skills. I have identified and actually predicted some movies based on the users preferences or interests. Like if a user enters a particular movie he or she is going to get five or ten days on the choices of a user five foot 10 movies that are similar to that movie. The user has selected and also it will generate the sentiments that is the reviews that people had given on that movie the commands basically positive negative and neutral and that is done through NLP. That is natural language. Processing which is a technique which allows to which allows to generate output from a sequence from a textual input. So it takes some text as an input and generates an output as positive negative and neutral that is the reviews given by that particular project. And so this project is a great because it helps in reviewing what a user preference is based upon the movie. Also allows the user to use it to generalize which movie to watch next if a user want to see through the commands and the ratings that are provided and those ratings are genuine because the data is taken from the API that is from the IMDb API data set and the data set that I had involved in that particular project was taken from kaggle and all so through web scraping on the websites. That is WWE. Yeah, so that's that was all about my project.",2,3
"Implementing a streaming approach and hosting a dedicated server are both solid strategies for latency reduction. Given your experience with Azure and OpenAI, how comfortable are you with AWS services, particularly those that are relevant to ML and NLP workloads, such as SageMaker or Lambda? Can you describe a scenario where you've utilized AWS in your machine learning projects?","Um, yeah, I I have used AWS sagemaker. Actually, we use AWS a lot in order to activities, even the chatbot that we have the that we host. We hosted on you know, ec2 and Docker and we you know serve multiple several thousand users a day in real time. So I have experience of deploying and scaling services on AWS. Secondly. I worked on AWS sagemaker towards mostly CI shirdi pipelines, so I have you know developed models then ran them or train them on ec2 by you know, spawning it from an AWS engagement. And then after the training is finished, I have successfully deployed it on ECR. So that is my experience is saying makeup. So I have done some work on sagemaker specifically. Lambda is not really. A familiar to me also I would say I know where it is used. But in my you know day-to-day activities, I really use Lambda so that we use Lambda as a company. So mostly our backend team handles it towards the you know, data refresher services and stuff like that. But I personally I deal with you know, ECR and sagemaker sometimes. but really",3,4
"Your approach to leveraging transfer learning and fine-tuning for audio classification is quite strategic. Given your experience with fine-tuning models for audio data, what specific challenges did you encounter with the pre-existing architecture during the fine-tuning process, and how did you address these challenges to ensure the model's effectiveness in classifying cat and dog sounds accurately?","Primarily when we started the project. We don't know anything about the architecture and we used to do different kinds of experimentation. So as the pre-existing architecture takes human sounds and classify the emotion in them. Well, we have to give cat and dog adios which are pretty to pretty new to the architecture. I mean so first that we tried different kind by trial and error method we say we try different types of activation functions and adding different kinds of layers to the architecture just by trial and error method and we got different kinds of accuracy at some point of time. We recognize a pattern where in specific layer if we add some specific activation functions and pull layers, like dance layers the accuracy of classifying dog and audio classification is increasing so In that way we overcome that challenge.",2,3
"Could you elaborate on the criteria you used to determine the ""good results"" and how you measured the accuracy of your models in these projects?",So there's something called as regression model. So we plotted that and while training there is something known as epochs. If we increase the number of epochs that model will get trained again and again and we can expect some accurate results from the model. I mean accurate output from the model. Thank you.,1,2
"It's interesting to hear about your use of BERT and Wav2Vec for the voice-based navigation system. Given your experience with NLP, particularly in developing sequence-to-sequence models for machine translation, could you describe how you approached the challenge of maintaining context and fluency in the translated text? What specific techniques or strategies did you employ to achieve a BLEU score over 30?","Machine machine translation all it needs to be curating the data properly. For example where I worked was we've taken a multi-line which multilingual Corpus and translated it to English language. The multilingual cost has more than one language. Let's say English in Hindi from social media and we created the data sets that we have we could actually get perfect information. And translation for that social media texts in English. And then later we created text mapping for those words so that the model would identify which would translate to which it and then we create a model. I mean we implemented a model called mbot with from a paper which actually defines as bi-directional Lotto recessive Transformer. Also it Transformer not like traditional 3 PTS and we use that model to deploy. I mean to implement the Machine translation and then actually we performed the blue score it actually reached 30, which is absolutely as human so. That's the approach.",2,3
"It's clear you have a comprehensive understanding of model serialization, cloud storage, and API integration for deploying machine learning models. The use of load balancing and regional deployment to ensure high availability and scalability is particularly noteworthy. Can you elaborate on how you monitor the performance of these models once they are in production, and what tools or practices you use to ensure they continue to perform as expected over time?","Yeah for monitoring of the measuring these stuff like whichever the things we have deployed or we make it as a product or a service to the clients for logging purpose. We have used the Splunk. And also the AWS cloudwatch logs, but that will eventually help you for the developers as well as clients, but the proper monitoring and troubleshooting purpose. We have a two of these few of these tools like one of the airflow but that will help for the monitoring. And another thing is like we have the pro media's so server, which will connect to always monitor our models as well as the services that gives a proper. picture will preventation of the models performance and so the logging and also monitor the troubleshoot as well and further Lee we have the grafana tool. Which will make the pie charts as well as the proper representation of this monitoring. And gives us a performance metrics as well.",2,3
"Certainly. I was asking about the challenges you encountered with the continuous action space in reinforcement learning and how the quantile truncated distribution approach helped address those challenges. Additionally, I'm interested in how you managed the increased computational resources required for this method.","Yes, so number one. So when we have a plane fpg algorithm algorithm, I compared that with different architectures one is ddpg and then td3 and I derived SPG equivalent of td3 and ddpg algorithms. And this setup a baseline for me about what is the expected performance with sample policy gradient approach on the td3 architecture and ddpg architecture. Next when we when I started exploring the distributional reinforcement learning number one the main. The main approach that I had over here was in front of having a scale our reward function. We'll have a distribution, right? So there are two things that I did here. I looked at a paper called as truncated quantile critics where what they did was this overcame the overestimation bias. And it took the advantage of distributional learning in three ways one. critics are given a distributional representation And we truncate all these representations of the critics predictions. And then we have an ensemble of multiple critics. So this is what is called as truncated quantile critics. So here we have a mixture of critics. There are n approximators and then each critic gives a particular Q value. And then we have a mixture of so many critics and then we take this truncated mixture and then we compare this Q value with spgs or Q value.",4,3
That sounds like a very efficient tool for job applications. Using Docker to manage dependencies is a smart choice.

"Given the memory management challenges in Python, your approach to leveraging C++ for critical data operations is quite innovative. Could you elaborate on how you integrated C++ code with your Python workflow, particularly in terms of managing data consistency and ensuring that the results from C++ operations were seamlessly integrated back into the Python environment for further analysis?","It so there are two approaches to this. One of them is creating a dynamic library and then calling it from python. So the dynamic library is basically a static Library which you compile with a standard C+ compiler like GCC or clang and then you would call it via a subprocess in Python. And the only way you were transfer data between the dynamic library and the python is through the python perimeters which are written in C. Um, another way of alleviating this position where it's much more advanced to something called piind 11 with pipeline. You can basically do one-to-one mappings between Python object like a numpy array down to AC plus of floating Point representation either float 32 or double or so on so forth. So effectively you can either do static Dynamic Library linking or using a pipeline",3,4
It seems there might have been a misunderstanding. Let's try again. I'm interested in hearing about a project where you did use AWS services.

So if you're going to project specifics I have implemented. Salient object detection. So which comes under?",1,3
"Thank you for sharing that. Can you describe a specific instance where you used PyTorch in your projects, and what advantages it provided?","Py, PyTorch was used when we were train training convolution neural networks. So because PyTorch is PyTorch is more effective than other, other model in finer detail. Suppose you have a class classification model, I have a I have a dataset in which I need to, I need to train on very fine details. Like, if click a photo from a screen and if you click the photo of real object, those 2 will be quite similar. But still, there really is something like moi pad pattern that appears when you click a photo from screen. So this thing was very much this thing could be very easily detected using when we to train model using we're using PyTorch and also in comparison to other models. So this is where I found PyTorch very effective in fine tuning on very minute details. Also, conversion from PyTorch to PyTorch Lite was very easy as compared to converting the model from PyTorch to, taking step by step and moving up to TensorFlow Lite models. Or PyTorch, PyTorch apparently provided PyTorch Lite provided better accuracies than TensorFlow Lite.",2,3
Implementing token limits and integrating services like LlamaGuard for toxicity detection are indeed proactive measures. How do you plan to monitor and update these security measures regularly to stay ahead of potential threats and vulnerabilities?,"so what we can do is we can keep and we can keep our regular analysis of the outputs from the model and like to run several checks, like having we can have vocabulary of words that are like trigger words that can be helped to identify whether the model so output that are being generated are in line with our aligned with human values or not. And like as a researcher, I think since I am up to date with a lot of papers that are being published and a lot of a lot of blogs that are published by Facebook and people working on large language models that provides me like I'm like a timeline if something new is being released and what are the results what are their results on the current and are there any new tasks that can be helpful to maybe evaluate whether these new Services can be much better much better. Helpful in our API or not. Maybe like basically monitoring the generated outputs from different models on a regular basis running. Let's say on a weekly basis sweeps. of from all the model outputs using some vocabularies some other it is.",2,3
"That's a comprehensive approach to document retrieval. Shifting focus to the in-context learning examples, how did you measure or ensure the adequacy of the Chain of Thought style questions in covering the possible reasoning paths for different types of financial questions?",Here so exactly what we did was we had some three or five short prompts for Chain of Thought that we manually created randomly selecting some questions from the training data set. Once we created these manual reasoning steps for these five or three questions. We generated reasoning steps for all the questions that were in the training set using in context learning and when we were predicting answers or creating doing numerical reasoning on tests and have set we use selected the test matching questions from the training set to create a dynamic prompt for every question in the test and have set So yeah.,2,3
"That's quite an impactful application of computer vision. Could you elaborate on the specific challenges you faced with the convolutional neural network during this project, and how you ensured the model's accuracy and generalization to different regions?","yeah, so the issue with getting satellite images was satellite images usually have a lot of you know noise. So if there is any cloud in the image, then you will not really understand. What is the ground value right? So this is pretty challenging and we had to work with daytime satellite image and also nighttime satellite image. So the nighttime satellite image show does which regions were illuminated right? And we would contrast it very highly and then try to estimate the poverty level.",2,3

"Training separate models for each class or ensuring class balance are both valid approaches. How did you evaluate which approach to take, and what were the factors that influenced your decision in terms of model performance and practical deployment considerations?","So like I have I have to trained like once once I have a created enough data for the both the objects like separately they have trying to separate models. So once like we have I have trying to like around 100-150 a books like once after a post that like I have seen the law till with the loss is reducing or not. Once once I have the final model like with the best weights. So with that like I have a performance using the test data, so the model is able to identify the object with around like 80 or 90% confidence.

We just kept the bias as false during our fine-tuning process and it's just like we have used the quantized Laura method for you know, fine-tuning it for our resume passing use cases. So basically it's like instruction fine tune where we had given the prompt with the particular instruction as well as the entities which we need to extract from the particular resume. So it's just that based on this one. We just created a supervised fine-tuning using the Qantas Laura method and our evaluation was done on the Rooks course. So Source were kind of better and the way we expected from the traditional ml has been increased by using this fine tune 11, so we are trying it best on different approaches like a different open source models. Like Jeffrey Mistral and also llama 7B and and we are trying to do so many techniques like, you know post a post trained quantization techniques for us to optimize the model.

Great! Let's start with your RHYM Threat Intellect project. Can you elaborate on the techniques and processes you used for collecting and structuring threat intelligence data?,"Okay, so for that we have Builder threat intelligence platform. So we have collected data from different open sources like my track and we are having cve details in four and nvd data set. So we have collected all the data using with scrapping so in web scrapping we have used both selenium and Beautiful soap techniques and after collecting the data, we have pre-processed the data by using nltk toolkits. So by using NLP techniques only so we have done tokenization limitations and all the stemming techniques and everything. So after pre-processing, we have played any are techniques so where it can identify the entities, for example, if there is a location where the threat is happening, so it is able to find out the location if it is a technical organization, it will try to find it the tag name as a company name. So something like so we have applied this any yet techniques to get the info from that data. We have collected after that. We have build an ontology graph for the trick happening. So if some group is There a PT 28 so for the data, we have collected all the information so like malware names. So what are the males and their CVS from where they are targeting? What are the places they are located in and what are the organizations are what platforms there are targeting like for example few groups might be good retail industry, but remaining groups may not be right. So similarly for each domain, they will be some groups at I mean attached to that so we have Done all these processing for this technology platform. Yeah, that's all.",4,3

"I appreciate your insights on adapting models for edge devices. Now, could you explain the concept of transfer learning and how it is commonly used in the context of deep learning?","Oh, okay. Sure. I think I just answered that question. But still I'll do it again. So transfer learning is basically where you already have some sort of pretrained models and you use them and you train them on your own data set. A little bit so that they learn from your data set as well that is where the transfer term comes in the transfer learning and then you can use these models for your own project these deep learning models.

So we designed a neural network of different types not even a single neural network. We build a different neural networks based on different pre-existing model using transfer learning Technologies. And sometimes we build our own neural network too. So the future extraction involves finding which attribute contribute most to the like prediction.

Now, considering your experience with both languages, how do you ensure that your code is maintainable and readable, especially when working on collaborative projects or when revisiting your own code after some time has passed?","Okay. Yeah, so like while I am coding on to these both of these languages, I ensure readability by first of all maintaining that indentation properly and space and and involving the spacing very nicely into my code so that it looks nice. If the code is presented nicely then obviously. There would be there would be an interest into that viewer in order to see that code and work on it. Also, the readability is enhanced through the core through the comments that I put on that particular codes like if there is a block of code I had to add I have I generally add a particular statement of a comment that what does that block of code is about and what does it do? So yeah comments are really important while you know, while performing any code because it really enhances the readability and improved like the realization of what I had done early whenever I forget that yeah that part of code consists of what so yeah comments are really good and by doing the proper indentation of that particular card all so If I would like like if there is some documentation that I would refer I add that part of documentation name or something site like in I include those also documentation reference in my comments so that whenever I'm facing any issue while reading that code or interpreting that code so like to prevent misinterpretation of the code that I had once written I refer to those documentation preference that I had already put inside my court. under those comments in a form of commence, so Sorry, yeah, so that is the thing that I refer by.

"Understood, you've tailored your solution to the specific constraints of semiconductor design, which is crucial for accuracy. Leveraging GPU for the final product is a smart move for performance. Shifting focus a bit, I noticed you've also worked with time series analysis. Can you discuss how you've applied your machine learning expertise to time series data, perhaps in the context of anomaly detection or any other relevant application?","Are multiple projects in which I have applied the time series application. So one of them is for example for the anomaly detection is the in the oea status OES is a special kind of the data in the semiconductor. That is the optical emission spectroscope data where the we get the web length and now we had to and now we know that the semiconductor manufacturing is a fast process as well as a as well as a complicated one. So that's why we have this thing known as the inline detection. So in line detection means that the anomaly will be detected as and when the semiconductor is is produced like there are multiple ways one is the offline offline will mean that once everything has already been done. Then you try to analyze and diagnose if any of the Wafers at some problem but in line will mean that as and when the wafer is inside the chamber and everything is going on you try to detect that now to do that. What I do is I I created this anomaly detection algorithm using the arima method now, I simply started with the arima because like I could not move to A complicated a very like the robust model because of the insufficiency of the data because the data is also limited while working in the semiconductor like you need to filter all kind of things and then get a very small data set and that's why I use the arima and using the arima what I used is based on all the previous Wafers. I tried to forecast the values for the like the next waveform and when the next wave will go in then that will produce a actual value and then I will try to calculate the difference between these two and when I calculate the difference between this two I try to see that how different is the actual from the real one and I will try to take the three sigma difference because if the predicted value and the actual value is three Sigma different from each other then that will mean that there is probably some anomaly. Otherwise if it is within the three sigma range, then we will consider it as a normal way for and we will just move on because we need to make sure that we like other than detecting the anomaly. We also had to make sure that we don't raise too many false alarm because that will create a hindrance in the production. And the other thing that I did with the time series data is the time series clustering that I will use in the in the Conductor there is a special kind of another special kind of the data which is known as the FDC data and FDC is the sensor data present in like the sensor data, which is collected as and when the wafer goes in so for each of the wafer or all the different sensors that are inside inside the chamber will be activated and they will record some kind of values the values may be the pressure temperature or some kind of the thing. And now what I will do is when I have to complete data for the whole way for I will try to Cluster them and For and using clustering like whenever there is some animal away for or something like that. Then it will be then it's Behavior will be different from what I already have Insight like from the from the previous way for inside the library and and I will try to like see that how is the anomalous way for is different from the all the correct way for us? Yeah.",4,3
"That's a solid approach to preprocessing the data. Now, considering your work with BERT for job proposal and resume matching, could you explain how you fine-tuned BERT for this specific task, and what kind of features or techniques you found most effective in improving the model's performance?","Okay, so but essentially a bi-directional encoder representation from a Transformers, right? So births underlying architecture is a Transformer and when we were working with word for resume matching the first thing was given a particular job description based on the number of applicants that are there we would extract key features from this particular application and match them with the key feature of extracted from the job description. And we would have you know score based on how much of the skill sets match with how much of the description so this was a threshold based approach. So we would keep a threshold of about 80% or 90% some kind of cosine score cosine similarity score and we would get the best applications of the lot.",2,3

So what I was doing is whatever user is typing the know that state of the texture was very continuously. So I used a you know on channel change function in my, you know button inside my button time.

"Certainly. When working on projects that require OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology, there's often a choice between using pre-trained commercial models or developing custom models from scratch. How do you decide which approach to take? What factors influence your decision, and how do you communicate the benefits of your chosen model to the stakeholders involved in the project?","Sure understood. So when we talk about pretend models, it is based on massive amount of data like text images or whatever a model that you're talking about referencing to the image or text. But the thing was the thing with those models is it's pretty much General and when you talk about your business use case that we talked there like specificity. So in order to have concrete results, we need to use some fine tuning of the model or if you're talking about the custom model. We can use that customer as well. The criteria will totally change for that. And that would that would be more useful. So we talked about them about the stakeholders. But yeah, they they usually say whatever popular or high in demand like opening a model or something that they usually go for the they usually tend to go but we do experiment and based on what results we are getting based on that. We propose a solution.",2,3
"Building an additional layer to capture user interaction data is a smart approach to understanding user behavior and improving the AI system. When you're designing this data capture system, how do you ensure that the data is both comprehensive and anonymized to respect user privacy, and what specific technologies or methodologies do you employ to maintain data integrity and security?","Yeah, it's really important. I'm glad he asked this question. But the thing is that you know, whenever we are actually sending this data, we make sure that there were like two filters one is actually from the user's point of one is at the from the chatbot point of view. So we will scan every message every user incoming message for any vulgarity or probably any conventional messages and all those things and we make sure that we must get information into the board. If there is any appropriate messages will have some inappropriate detector, which actually identifies the threshold level and the level was like too high, you know, we will not send the data and probably will ask the you know user to refresh the data. So if that was keep on happening, we will have an alert system where in like the same user was keep on repeating the same as sending some inappropriate messages like within this time slot, you know, we will kind of you know, hold the use of for like sometime and probably investigate and It sounds to be like user is doing that intentional probably block them because they are you know, not utilizing the system correctly and probably wasting the time and also from the Bots point of view. So we will make sure that the same indicator was not giving any appropriate messages or wrong messages, you know, because you might ask like how can actually build a bomb something like that and that once in the technology the latest tools can easily Answer that but you know opinion is really important to you know filter out the user response and Bot responses. Also while filtering that we have to you know, make sure that we filter like pii personal and inferior information Phi personal health information and PCI as a payment card industry like a credit card. It is blanket and all Pi like name email phone number and all PHA was like basically, you know identifying like call Healthy related data like a representative that they have a hypotension or not, whether they have any articles, but they have any comer preconditions or not. All these things comes under PhD. So like we have different filters for each of these three main categories and we make sure that you know, these three categories were not stored and they were stored there were stored in such a way that it actually know as for the guidelines like gdpr and all those things were there, right? So we store the information if by taking the concerned as well like terms and conditions if we have a proven to store that we store that you know as per these things. So that's how we maintain the security and privacy and all so making sure that both user and the chatbot was not it is getting what it needs its kind of filtering everything else.",2,3
"That's understandable. Let's move on to a different topic. In your experience with React, how do you manage state in functional components, and what are the advantages of using hooks like useState and useEffect?","But, again, the closure so those are good in order to, once you wanna set the state of like, for example, in different company, you want a different state of that variable or something. So it won't affect the the, the state of that variable in the previous component. So that's mainly I was using it. But then you can change the states of those variables anytime.

Given your experience with AWS and machine learning, can you discuss how you've implemented MLOps practices in your workflow, particularly in the context of model versioning, continuous integration, and continuous deployment (CI/CD)?","yeah, so for for that purpose I have used ec2 instance only and there I created a Docker file and which contained all the dependencies or all the requirements that the target system needs and whenever I so, I I connected it to through GitHub right and then whenever I Write a code or let's say train a model and I commit the quote I use I as soon as I do get push. It directly goes to the easy to instance and deploys my whole image as a container. So yeah in inside the city instance and yeah, that's what I did and Yeah, that is all the CSC pipeline.

"Given the complexity of your model and the need for both supervised and unsupervised learning, how did you balance the trade-off between model accuracy and computational efficiency, especially considering the real-time requirements of traffic monitoring?","Here, so this project was actually funded by the California Transportation. So they had a base data which was available. So by using a small amount, let's say 30% of annotated data as compared to 70% of unsupervised data. So what I did was I trained multi-object detection model which used to track the vehicles using yellow V5 and get the count of the different vehicles on the highways now once we get the count then we use an unsupervised patient temporal clustering model to actually know how many trucks are together that is whether they are in nearest neighbors. So as you see on generally on highways if there are four trucks in similar in seamless, let's say there is a four lane highway there are four trucks which are going parallelly so that leads to traffic conditions. So these are some of the different methods which we can improvise using unsupervised special temporal clustering and with a supervised learning approach of multi object detection with yolo version 5 you we can actually detect those trucks and then we can cluster daughter's accordingly and Give a good traffic estimate as to how much traffic is present. Why exactly it is happening. And so",4,3
"Certainly! In Python, the ""yield"" keyword is used in the context of defining a generator function. When you use ""yield"" in a function instead of ""return"", it transforms the function into a generator. The key difference is that ""return"" terminates a function and sends a specified value back to its caller, while ""yield"" pauses the function, saves its state, and then continues from where it left off the next time it's called. This ability to pause and resume execution is what makes generators memory efficient, as they don't need to store all their values in memory at once. Instead, they generate values on the fly, which can significantly reduce memory usage, especially with large datasets or computations. Given this explanation, how might you now consider using the ""yield"" keyword in your Python projects, particularly in the context of AI and ML where memory efficiency is a concern?","Yes, so I said that I'm doing a project related to Active Learning methodologies right in this actual learning methodologies. What we do is we don't train the model with the entire data set first. We train with the small Point small set of data set. We calculate the representative less information less scores using uncertainty sampling method and we Give it to the user to label them. And again, we'll retrain with the new label dataset in this country text finding information and representativeness, which is a combination of entropy marginal difference and tsne pay us similarities everything. We have to pass the many images to those functions so which is not so memory efficient. So I would like to use this New Concept which is you said as a converting the function to the generator using the ill function, I would definitely use this concept in my actual learning project which can minimize so much of my memory usage because I was using literally a 10000 300 images for my training data so I can leverage my memory efficiency by using this generator concept. Well, so thank you for that. Europe",3,2
"That's a very innovative approach to automating code generation. It sounds like you've effectively leveraged OpenAI's API for backend logic optimization. Given your experience with web scraping, could you describe a project where you utilized web scraping and how you handled challenges such as dynamic content or rate limiting?","So I had I worked on a project there. a viewer developing an application that could detect whether the person in the image has a specific sort of disease or not the two inputs that could be taken were images or the symptoms that the person was experiencing. So to create the data set for this sort of application. I used web scraping basically WebMD pages that are very commonly referred to by doctors all around those were referenced and the symptoms the disease the symptoms the corresponding diseases and their commonly used solution approaches were taken and the data set was created. So for dynamic Pages, what was done was? the data set once created was kept and when a fresh scraping was done the data then collected was compared and a only the common parts were kept so as to not let any not let any undesired data remain in the database that could affect the models capabilities. That's where I used web scraping.",2,3
Great! I see from your resume that you've worked on a project involving one-shot learning for medical image analysis. Could you walk me through the approach you took for this project and how you implemented it using TensorFlow?,"Sure, so the current problem that I faced doing that particular time was we had a particular data set of value of just a few hundred of labeled data set for something called chromosome analysis. So we had to build a model for classification regarding that so we couldn't go with the conventional class CNN because the problem is with such less dated always under fits and it's very difficult to generalize and the option that I took was going with contrastive learning. Which turned out to be very well at good and generalizing compared to a CNN based approach. So the approach is very simple. We had around 100 100 to 200 label data. So I built a service network, which is basically two Networks. Of the same network. So what this does is it takes an image as an input and gives you an output as an embedding. And the idea is that you give it pairs of images sometimes even triplet if you using triplet loss. So I used to close in this case. So it took three images One images called anchor image. The other image is an image, which is similar to this anchor image, right? The other image is something that's not so it's not the same classes jacket image. So what it does is it tries to create embeddings such that the distance or The euclidean distance you can say between the embeddings of the ones in the same class is minimized and the embedded distance between the embeddings of the ones and the different class is a maximized. So at the end when you convert an image with a Samus Network into embedding space it tries to minimize the distance between inter-class and Max is a difference between indoor. inter class so this is how much short learning for you used and the main benefit in this particular thing was that we were able to generalize very well, even though we had a very less data set compared to training a deep CNN which was not able to generalize later on when we got more data Weasley shifted to deep sea animals, but with this limited data one shot learning with Sam's networks worked great.",5,4

"It's great that you were able to quickly diagnose the issue using Splunk and client feedback, identifying the root cause as an exception case in the model's handling of header detection. Implementing a more robust validation process to guide the client's file uploads is a smart solution to prevent similar issues in the future. In light of this experience, how do you approach improving model robustness and exception handling during the development phase to minimize such issues post-deployment?","Here we have the proper end-to-end testing before deploying a model in any region or any service. We do a different checks in terms of correctness of the data and we have the proper error handling and tests generated by the python Pi tests, which will make the code. Better in terms of different use cases. And also we after completion of this development of the project. We will make it available to The Client First certain time, but not giving it fully so that like they will test with their real time files and understood like okay the whether the model is accurate enough to be used for the proper clients or not that we ensured based on the client's approval only and also we have within the regions we have the similar projects and issues.

Image or even some pages and This falls into the explain which is lying or whatever. It is. Thus explainer will give an explanation which is a visual mask of the object or the region of Interest consider. You have an object a dog or a cat. So you just the model just predicted. It is a dog and the model developed with deep learning will have more regions out of the region of interest, but this model with attention mechanisms will have A better mask, which is closely to the object, which is the dog. That is how we can interpret. We also have the score which is pixel is score. That will map the real image and explain us output and also the output from the explainer output from the deep learning model. All these features have mapped and the feature with highest.

Additionally, how might you utilize large language models to further refine the system's performance in this area?","Um depends on the you know resources I have so I would, you know get a large Corpus first to you know, train the model accordingly. so I would start by. Taking a small model. Let's say but model or let's say still but so to be even smaller and I would first put my efforts into getting the right data. So a good part of my experiment there was also to collect the data and curate it towards this task. So for fortunately I have some data sets in mind that I used and which are actually, you know, competitively good. So I would rather data first then train a model and get the Baseline before finding it and evaluate the model before finding it then start fine tuning the model and evaluate it again. And then if the results are good, I would you know, put it to implementation in the real world. So the biggest challenge I found especially when using large language models in production or settings is that they have a good a bigger latency, right? So I would first try to you know use a small model to get the task done and have a good latency and serve it in production. You know with less cost and less latency. So if that works good enough, then I don't see the need to transition to large language models. But if I really do need to then I would do the same thing. I would find you in them. But as we can say large language models are really very very, you know, expensive to train and very hard to even infer. So I would use our you know, parameter efficient finding like Laura to use adapters, you know specialized adapters to find tune the llm towards a single task. So I would use adapters in this case also to find in the model and essentially then in the production settings just you know implement or not Implement just import the adapters for that particular task.

I continuously monitor the distribution of incoming data to detect shifts or changes in the data characteristics over time this involves comparing the statistical properties of new data with the historical data and identifying the deviations that may indicate data drift. Another is the model drift detection. I monitor the performance of the deployed model by tracking key performance metrics such as accuracy precision recall and a fun school over the time in addition to monitoring data drift. I also monitor called monitor the quality of the data to ensure that it meets the expected standards and requirements. Finally. I set up alerting mechanisms and log in Frameworks to notify operators and shareholders of any issues or anomalies detected in the deployed model. When model drift or degradation is detected. I take proactive measures to address the issue by returning the model on a new data or updating the model architecture or hyper parameters continuous integration and development deployment that is cicd pipelines are used to automate the process of model retraining and deployment ensuring the deployed model remains up-to-date effective over the time.",4,3

They provide just a simple parameter that can be used to integrate self-consistency and it doesn't take additional time because I think they have paralyzed the models. One thing that we can do is rather than using an api-based approach. We can have multiple models deployed like a different 7 billion 7 billion parameter models like Gemma llama Mistral and when we get outputs from all these not since they won't require a lot of GP resources to run so we can in a way using outputs from different models and analyze calculate a Confidence Code that will help us to understand whether the answer that we are going to give to the user is should be trusted or we should do some additional pre-processing to further interact with the,2,3

I have matched it to e-commerce data and the palette I've used this series. So this gives so box plot of day of week versus purchase amount and similar way of created a bar plot. I mean I've used plot dot figure function to set the figure size and then as soon as per plot method to give the bar plot. The same way in the bar plot function. I've used the parameters such as X Y to give the access and buy access and data as he Commerce data and estimator function to give the sum of the data and see I set it to none with the pilot as muted.

Could you describe your typical workflow for deploying a machine learning model using these technologies, and perhaps share some best practices you've developed for maintaining and updating models in a production environment?","Oh sure. So when it comes to the pipeline of deploying ml models, it generally goes in this manner wherein we would first update our code with regards to whatever latest changes have been made to incorporate any changes that have resulted into additional libraries or additional changes in the environment that existing Docker file goes through some minor tweaks which takes into account any any new additions to the environment that are necessary for the model to run when it comes to AWS next when we when it's when the code is pushed into deployment. The latest changes are taken automatically into account by the AWS E2 based machine. It takes it ensures that it tracks down what the latest version is, since we at every single release we update the versions. That is how the How the AWS Cloud also comes to know which version to pick up for a part for that particular deployment when it comes to picking the model. So with every new deployment there is an update in the version for for which the model needs to be appropriately selected and is fairly automatic automated based on using the AWS to Cloud architecture.",2,3

Could you now explain the concept of transfer learning and how you have applied it in your machine learning projects?,"it Sure, so when it comes to transfer learning what it means is that when a particular model is being trained for a for a single task that model now becomes equipped to better equipped to be utilized for another task as well. So a small example of that is how we first trained in the in the use case for keyword recommendation on a publisher URLs in at media.net. What we were trying to do here is that we were trying to find the birth model so that we the embeddings are optimized for the pairwise classification task of predicting a click versus no click. So for a given URL and a given keyword, we wanted to know whether a keyword will get clicked on a particular URL and for this particular task, we wanted to find you on the court model to generate embeddings. So we utilize we use the burst bird based. On Case Model here. So before we find tune this model on the pairwise classification task first. We went ahead with a fine tuning on the month mask language modeling task. So what how it helped here is that it ensure that the model learned the patterns the language patterns and the syntax and the semantics used in our keywords as well as in the URL. What's the URL? Of the clean URLs that we were using once the model was trained on this particular MLM task this this specific fine-tuned model was then utilized and for the pairwise classification tasks as well this particular learning helped ensure that we could find tune the model to generate better and more contextually more contextual embeddings for our task.",4,3

If the idea of the age rank was incorporated based on The engagement and engagement score. So the engagement score was more integral to what are product team wanted. Like what what were the which kind of Engagement scored higher for our users? So in our case, we give a higher weightage to the type of posts that the users were having an interaction with then next came the specific users or the specific users in the network with whom the user interacted with and then in within the engagement as well. The comments were ranked higher than the likes and this is how based on these factors there was a score that was evaluated for each of the post in the users feed and using this code. We had ranked the posts in a sequential manner. This is how the algorithm worked. And when it came to how much it succeeded as opposed to the initial recency based approach. I would say that it saw a significant Improvement in engagement. That is how we evaluated the performance as opposed to the previous performance the previous performance which was recently based saw a prevented the users from seeing a lot of posts that were more relevant to them because they appeared or way in the day as opposed to the recent post. And hence. They did not get to engage with those posts. We saw that about in a period of a single week. There was five times increase in the amount of likes that uses made overall on different posts. There were three or 300% increase in the comments that they used were making these are some of the observations that we made which gave us an idea that now the users were each able to view more relevant content that they were initially able to view based on just the recent ranking. methodology",4,3

Exactly. We first of all use Python then we switch to Java because of the like as Java is faster for using selenium and like it is more what we can say using this field as a knowledge of selenium is pretty good on the internet for the Java language rather than instead of Python language.

We utilized about four textual explanation right now. I want to share something about the project that we developed. It is for a different scenario. So people can't trust models or AI in the wild, which is critical Asian making So based on the analysis or based on the models decision. We have to interpret whether the model is designing correctly or not.",1,2
"Certainly, I can repeat the question. In the context of your work on EEG signal interpretation, could you discuss the trade-offs between using a shallow and wide neural network architecture versus a deep and narrow one?","Yes, so trade-off between a shallow and a deep a deep learning model is two things. Number one shallow models. Usually learn very simple structures. So in EEG data set that we were extracting from humans. We had a lot of electrode data that was stored in our database. And shallow models only learned very simple structures and most of the time they wouldn't really converge. The accuracy rate that we were getting were hardly about. 50 to 60% which is essentially not so useful for EEG data, especially in medical scenario. and good examples of Shalom models are You know a neural network with only three layers. Right, whereas a deep learning model, which has more number of layers. There are two there are there. It's a complex structure so it can understand and process a lot more complex data. And each layer can be seen as a feature extracted that transport the transforms the given input into the next layer and every layer starts getting more and more abstract data and meaningful for the task at hand. Right? So deep models are more powerful and flexible and hence. They are, you know, If they are used for large. large complex tasks, but also they are more tough to train and interpret smaller models are easier to interpret whereas deep models are much more challenging to interpret about the decision that they took",4,3
"Your approach to curating and mapping the data for machine translation is quite thorough. Using mBART, a bi-directional model, is a solid choice for maintaining context. Given your experience with mBART and other large language models, how do you handle the computational challenges that come with training and fine-tuning these models, especially when working with limited resources? Can you also touch on how you've used tools like TensorFlow or PyTorch to optimize your training process?","When it comes to NLP and large language models and fine-tuning them, especially we use a technique called Laura which which is low ranking adaption where we actually Downstream the large language model weights to declared application so that we don't have to deal with all the weights of the model and also the computational resources won't burn out. Rather than traditional free training and changing all the weights of the model. We only change we only add another set of layer in the end of the model and then try to tune those weights. So in terms of computational power, we I always tend to choose Laura for llm optimizations and all also if it comes to traditional model fine tuning using either in the tensorflow OR Fighters where we actually wear rather I actually Deploy, or create pipelines for various models.",2,3
"Great! I see from your resume that you've worked on a variety of projects, including a chatbot for NEET exam preparation. Can you walk me through how you decided to use LangChain for this project, and what challenges you faced with its integration?","Yeah, sure. Like it's a medical related to neet exam. So it's a chatbot. So here we have a set of documents related to neet exams. Like it has a variety of subjects like biology physics chemistry and using this generative are it will take all the documents and convert into a vectors and stone in a vector DB and based upon the use of query the relevant chunks or the relevant documents will be that's",1,2

I connected it to my pytorch training code. So whenever I run a training I can monitor it with mlflow and there I can see all the versions of my models and all the performance metrics written side by side of each model and then I can decide which one to go for I was so experienced with integrating wits and biases. for monitoring and yeah, that's all.",2,3

"You've given a clear explanation of the mean average precision metric. Now, could you describe a situation where you had to optimize a machine learning model for deployment on edge devices, and what specific techniques or tools you used for this optimization?","Okay. So basically I have not used for optimization on machine learning models, but I did on deep learning models. So deep in deep learning we had neural networks. So there were two methods that we primarily used one as I mentioned earlier as well. We use tensor RT to optimize the model performance on Nvidia gpus and the other method was quantization. So basically what how quantization works is you have so basically relatives are just maths and in contact position suppose you round up a float to nearly to an integer suppose. The number is 2.48 and you rounded up 2.5 and then the calculation so that way the calculations are done much faster and you can optimize the performance. So these are the two methods that I have used to optimize or deep learning model.",2,3
Could you elaborate on the potential future enhancements or expansions for this system once it's successfully deployed?,"limited to, parking area where we are detecting humans and pets. We can Yes. First of all, we can improve the models in the later version whenever new models for object detections are in in are brought into the, industry. We can explore it. And if they are working faster and better, then we'll try to update our models and and replace them with the faster and lightweight models with better better accuracies. Also, we can improve the technology behind this like we can try train the model to detect properties or any any malpractices happening or any, any, potentially, any, activities that could be harmful to the people in the area. Like, we can train train on those objects. Like, we can create the time duration. Like, at night, the the modes would be different. Like, it's should be vigilant, detects anything that is, not acceptable, or not expected unexpected behaviors among the humans or anything like that. So we can train that and improve the safety of the people living in the in the, society.",2,3
"Manual checking is a good approach for initial validation. Since you mentioned using Bedrock for relation extraction, could you elaborate on how you integrated these different models into your RAG++ pipeline and what the overall architecture of the pipeline looked like?","Okay. Yeah, so overall architecture in that sense was like we had 13k documents. So we had to do first the OCR on those 13k document and we had to clean that data and put the data in form of chunks in the vector DB. And after that we had to build our AG pipeline that included building a retriever like data Retriever and model which which can answer the date answer the question based on the data review. And that is like the top kids songs that were retro from the data. So that was the basic RSG pipeline. Other than that we assist the knowledge graph. So in that case for each Chunk we had to create a metadata where it will Store The Entity and relation and using those we could find those data for any like relationship kind of question from that.",2,3
"Feature engineering is crucial for improving model performance. Could you give an example of a feature you engineered that had a significant impact on the loan eligibility model? Additionally, in the context of hyperparameter tuning for the stock price prediction, how did you go about selecting the optimal parameters for your model?",So in a loan eligibility we engineered the feature. That is the most important was the credit credit history and the credit score and it's the and the salary these three were the main important features and in the stock price prediction. The hyper parameters we used were the open open price close price. That was the most important and the previous days open Rising close price.,1,3
"It's good to hear that you have some experience with Webflow for creating project websites.

Did you have to work with any developers to integrate the design into a live website, and if so, how did you handle that collaboration?",Like based on what project mine is I used to see some relevant websites. So I used to see the how they have designed what things they have put in their website and using that I try to achieve it using webflow like slider. So I've seen a website where there was a slider Lively moving images in a website and then I have searched for Sliders in webflow enough. I found a section where I can add those sliders. I have just simply added the those things in my website and I have to some some of my friends help in choosing the right color to our website because that is also very important to make our website very attractive.,1,2

Additionally, could you elaborate on the techniques you used to address skewness in financial distributions within your generative model, ensuring that the synthetic data captured and preserved these skewed characteristics?","Um, you can fit a skew distribution with a mixture of gaussians AKA gaussian mixture model and then by reflecting on the number of components, you can basically work. Reproduce any distribution you like in terms of checking whether or not a surface or financial heuristic was coherent. We use gathers svi, so you can calculate the calendar and Butterfly Arbitrage at every single pair for strike and time space or as we say Delta's and Tenors in finance and by doing gathers model you're able to check whether or not the devil utility surface is actually architecture free.",2,3
"It's clear you've made significant improvements to the system. Given the issues with the initial Python code for language detection, how did you address the accuracy and speed concerns, and what impact did your changes have on the system's performance?","Okay. Um, so because currently I'm working in legal domain and you know in legal domain the contracts they can be in any language. Right and there can be Snippets of different languages in each other's contracts and clauses Etc. So this language detection part always it is not the most important. part of the pipeline but it is where it all starts and that's why when I looked at the code code is let's say it's a flask based plus we are using Kafka topics, so It's async in nature. Right and there were some issues with the uses of multi-processing as well. Um, so that was one thing another thing was that let's say the way they were loading the models. In the flask app that was not proper, right? So they were a couple of things that I noticed there were small things. I think that they're not so like not very What do you call it is not something that impactful according to me. But still there were some nitpicks that I found and eventually they turned out to be a good optimization techniques, like for example in language detections. They were a lot of rules and reduces because their existing system was not very well lased for Asian languages and I simplified that logic I I used the GBA tokenizer and I looked into it. It's for specifically for each languages specifically Chinese and Mandarin, so Yeah, I looked into that tokenizer and I tried to find a better logic to segment our sentences as well, especially quickly in Chinese. Yeah, so that was the language detection. But secondly as I told you in language translation because I used Todd serve and I was serving the models on kubernetes directly and they were CPU based. Right? So and I was using Kida, so that means that it was Auto scaling right? So we were You it was pretty efficient. Yeah.",4,3
"Stemming is indeed efficient for reducing words to their root forms. Given your experience with both, could you highlight a scenario where you might choose lemmatization over stemming in an NLP project?",Yeah lamentation over stemming can be beneficial at times. Let me think for a second and I'll come up with the answer limitation over stemming. can be beneficial and scenarios like Limitation reduces words to the directory form which is linguistically valid it involves understanding the context and meaning of a word vast stemming reduces words to their root form by removing the suffixes. It is more you it is more of and heuristic approach. So it does not always result in a valid World valid word stemming is faster and less resource intense that can be a bit slower. and resource dragging or you can say resource.

"That's a great application of NLP to streamline lead qualification in the real estate industry. When training the NLP models for this chatbot, what kind of data preprocessing and feature engineering did you find most effective, and how did you measure the performance of the models in a conversational context?","So this was a since it was an application. We need to have like different intents. So, of course, I need to prepare the data set, you know, and also make sure that I'm not actually kind of, you know, making a bias and then we're preparing the data set, right? So I kind of you know, make sure that I select the one the best model. So I choose a diet class work. So this debt classifier is actually dual intent and entity Transformer model. So what it does was, you know, it can do both intent identification any extraction as well. So whatever the data that I kind of prepared, you know, I mean it made sure that you know performs both in 1010 extraction at the same time. So I kind of gave like for each intent like 20 why variety of examples and these examples for like discreet and I'll share the same time Variety in the nature. So I wanted to know bring some additional noise as well. So sometimes what happens was, you know. I made sure that I kind of handle the multi Indians as well. So. These are this was a Transformer. So there was not feature engineering. So yeah, there were different features that you know, like the number of foods the tokens and the previous votes and all those things that Transformer model take care of and yeah, that's how I kind of help in the future engineering and debt extraction.",2,3

I converted those data into embeddings then stored those data in vector vector databases for that. I had used Nano DB and postgres school and then I had Used those in for converting those those strings or we can say sentences into embeddings. I had used openai's embedding model and then And then those Vector embeddings were used to those that embeddings of the I can say of the GST notifications where matched with the embeddings of the users questioned or users query and they would give the relevant answers based on that.",2,3

Intel's Innovative design contest where we get to build a board with the computer vision and operate the port based on the commands that the model gave and then actually go on plug the plant the further down to the project would be deploying it in a large scale for identifying medicinal plants and which are really rare and also get to develop medicines out of the models that we use there were five and in order to deploy it we chose a joke loud.",2,3
"That's a very comprehensive approach using MediaPipe and OpenCV for hand landmark detection. It's impressive that you've mapped ASL letters to the hand coordinates. For the word formation part, how did you handle the logic to interpret the sequence of letters into words, and what kind of challenges did you face in ensuring the system was responsive in real-time?","So what we did is we are we have created one a notepad kind of thing in taking the and what we are doing is we are showing the sign languages in the screen on the webcam. And when I am supposed to suppose, this is the suppose. This is the in sign language in ASL suppose. This is the a for alphabet a so I'm capturing the screen by pressing f it will freeze the screen and it will get the output and it will print it if the terminal and that terminal will be the notepad for the notepad that we build from the taking time. So this is how we form the words. The challenge is we faced was sometimes it was taking to somebody it was taking too complex algorithm complex alphabets because it was stitching between some of the letters which work quite similar like this is a and this is this is M. So it is quite a bit confusing for the machine as well and also for us to handle this coordinates with respect to their 2D coordinate system. So this was the challenges that we face. But anyhow, we came to the conclusion that after performing Several testing several accuracy functions we come to conclusion that we came to 90% accuracy, which is quite better than the meaning of the models which is present in the market because some of the models that have been presented in the market are quite clearly based on deep learning or machine learning but this is a purely functional based system function.

We need to pre-process the data again, and it's like a whatever the data we are collecting from the SQL. So it's like a raw data. So we need to again at a pre-process something and for realizing in our machine learning models. So when we are trying to deal with the raw data, and so and the indexing sequel what we have mentioned something there and we need to mention and different set of requests. It might be or likely quotes or the tool maybe a more than two like records for the sales and all.

Basically, there are few metrics which evaluate the quality of the image generated, like FID scores. So we try to, compare the original model FID scores and the compressed model FID scores. And as you are, rightly told, after compression, there is obviously some loss because of the cross conversation process involved in it, and it's a lossy process. So, basically, the for this course were, not exactly as similar to the original, model, but a slightly lesser one. But that was okay because the application was different. And, the usage of GPU and other stuff were also a main factor here. And, the compression, mainly, it was done by conversation. So the weights which from the original model were quantized in such a manner that the output generator is closely similar to the one which is, generated from the original model.",2,3

What I had Incorporated here was the first the first rollout was a recency based ranking model where the posts were ranked in the manner of recency for all the all the followers of particular user later. We moved on to an edge rank based approach wherein you take into account the interactions of the user other users or the followers of the current anchor user and we had to take into consideration the score based on the past interactions and the engagement of the followers and ensure that the relevant topics or the relevant posts based on the users that were being posted were appeared at the top as a post to other type of hosts. So let's see a user is more interested in open houses and they had an Engaged in the past with open house kind of posts related post updates and commented there and like their or shared with other users and this user continued to get such kind of such kind of posts at the top or ranked at ranked higher. Whereas someone else who was more interested in list. Based post so more of that sort of content at the top. So this is how we had integrated different solutions.

And you also have a series like V 0 to V right now we 7 is going on. So you also have having a series of YOLO models. We used YOLO before we fight so we did not get like we got the pretend model. So and we had the images of every class is so first thing that we did that we made the five six classes of the and then we resize the images in a particular size like we needed a same size for every every means so we recycled resize the image of this image and after that we Load the pretend data pretend model of YOLO and we train our then we then after that we added two layers two days later to the to the base model of f Smith. and after that we trained but in that we did not do anything more because you know the we had a image and we Images was right. And also yeah, we also did the annotations because when you are when you are using any when you are training any detection model, so for the images you have to have The annotation of that because your model is going to use the notation the notation was your bounding box bounding box the coordinates and also the bounding box coordinates all and also you name of whatever class of that so we have wanted that txt file for that. So me I use the label MZ to annotate the data and we use that they noted data to the YOLO model and we train the model and also we that model so we're going to integrate in the Android device. So the YOLO was in fights. And mobile device is mostly working. Like it's very feasible to a work on the TF Lite model as compared to dot PT because bites were Fighters gave the model in don't pity format. So the ending wanted the model format or flight. So that was very you can say that was a difficult part to change the YOLO model here to to in to TF Lite, but also providing a script for changing the dot PT model to TF Lite like you can export your model in TF Lite former. You don't need to spot your motor dot PT if you are you whether you are using pythons for that. So YOLO, so that time we first we did we changed the road PT model into one and x and we use the openvino to change that model into at 5. And after that we change that model into day of light and then we send that model to the Android team. for the testing part",2,3
"Cosine similarity and Earthmover's distance are indeed effective metrics for evaluating the quality of word embeddings, especially in translation tasks where semantic similarity is crucial. Given your experience with these metrics, how do you approach the challenge of fine-tuning pre-trained models for specific NLP tasks, and could you give an example of a time when you successfully fine-tuned a model for a particular use case?",So in fact in this dictionary creation itself the model that was present was not very was not giving very good results for the translation tasks that we were trying to perform. So instead we tried some things we tried a fine tuning the layers and the drop values a bit and that actually helped a lot because it introduced a lot of introduce the bit of necessary randomness. And give better results.,2,3
"That's a very interesting approach, leveraging contrastive learning for a small dataset. Given that you transitioned to using deep CNNs later, can you discuss the trade-offs between the two approaches in terms of model performance and computational efficiency? Also, how did you ensure that the Siamese network was not overfitting with such a small dataset?","Okay. So the first thing is when we transition to a deep CNN. The obvious rate of was the first thing we needed to have a large amount of data for it to train on. So once we got to liquidated we have clinics started giving us a lot of data. So use that data to train a deep CNN. But one of the good things about the defense is that it does not require generating and storing embeddings for each data set to compare against during inference time. So the inference was obviously was faster and deep Channel. And with more data we could officially trained it to be more generalized. So I would say it was better than the contrast learning approach which should be used only if you have to because otherwise there's problem one that is when you are trying for inference you have to Take everything from each and every class related data set original data set and store it so that you can check against closest when you are infected. So that's one problem is networks. So I think there's not much shade of it was a good thing that we use and later with more data now coming to your question about how we generalize the data with this particular. Service networks, even though it was a small data set. Well one thing was used a lot of data augmentation because of the small amount of data set. We had we changed the angles the blooding effect we added. Bluntness, we are lines where so many different types of data augmentation methods. We have applied to make sure that we do not offer it in this particular scenario. And then we didn't experiment of CNN versus semester at that level that amount of data set. The time is network is providing more generalization.",4,2

"Your explanation of adaptive regularization techniques and how they could be implemented through custom callbacks is quite insightful. Could you provide a specific example of how you might define a criterion or metric within your custom callback to dynamically adjust the strength of a regularization technique, such as in the case of adaptive L1 or L2 regularization? What kind of criteria or measurements could be used to inform these dynamic adjustments?","The various the criteria for adapting the regulations and can vary or the choice depends on the specific characteristics of the problem at hand. Some of them outline based out the basic and but that can be used in most of the cases are the magnitude of model parameters where we adjust the regularization strength based on the magnitude of the model parameter, if the parameter becoming too large increase the regulations change, we can implemented by calculating the metric presenting the average magnitude of the model parameter and use it to adapt the regularization strength. And another one another one such approach will be gradient magnitude. The idea is to the regularization during training. It works in the way that it creates a large regularization. And that is the regularization the great training and use them as a criteria for just in the regularization say",2,4

What specific metrics or techniques do you use to evaluate the quality of the learned representations in the unsupervised setting?","Sure, when I mean total understanding of the data, I mean what are the trends in the data that we as human current understand it in such a higher dimensional level. So in order to make sure that model reaches to that state we do this all these optimizations optimizations in the training processes and later when we have to test it in some real world example then we create a classification a conventional classification problem with the classification any other type of human Network or regression based on our tasks don't Downstream task followed by it and then pass those models rates those models embeddings to these classification model and then actually get to test. Its applications on the wide variety of data and the real world available because we directly can't use self-supervised learning embeddings in such a format that we could we could we at least we could understand anything from it.",2,3

"Those are indeed powerful augmentation techniques. How do you plan to balance the trade-off between model complexity and the interpretability of your CNN model, especially given the potential deployment in real-world scenarios where interpretability is crucial?","Yeah, so the thing is if we focus on computational and computational be computational more computational power. We need to have more computational power to implement those complex models and algorithms, which will of course have a little bit effect on the interpretability, but then we can do our best to make it interpretable. But the same time accuracy and getting the model work to its best self is more important that I would think I would make my best interpretability using my good software coding methodologies.",1,2
"I understand that you might have been cut off inadvertently. Could you please rephrase your response to the question about the trade-off between using pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for specific tasks, particularly in the context of document processing?","Seriously, I would love to do that do that. So in terms of document processing, okay? So there are several fine tuning methods that one can apply. you know because these LLS they are always trained for a large generic task so we can always find unit to any Downstream tasks based on our use case, so Maybe one of the method that one can integrate is instruction fine tuning like I used that for one of my projects. But yeah, like what you can do. It's like in prompt engineering. The most you can pass is like five to ten examples like like that's the maximum amount of examples you can pass pass in fuse or prompting. Otherwise like your the cost to a it would increase right so In instruction fine tuning, what you can do is like you can pass more than 1000 examples. While and fine tune your model like you can just pass the instructions along with the prompts and include 1000 more than 1000 examples and then you can find tune your model best on those instructions. And you can like pass similar like based on your use case like you can give specific instructions and those things. they throw using those things you you would be able to find tune your again, like if whenever asking about the trade up, it's always necessary important to consider the Cost like the time that is saved by applying this solution and all so the amount that is going like that. It's going to cost to integrate this solution. If you are okay with the amount that is going to be spent on developing this solution. Then you can always go to the fine tuning part. And if you are more focused towards saving the amount and focusing on like you are not you are more oriented to what's cost effective Solutions, then you can always opt for you know, like other Logics like python Logics if you can if that can work then yes. Like it always depends on the use case.",2,3

But yeah, like in NLP, I used a charity API, but that was not that model because he they providing the API to use in any text classification and Q&A chat box chatbot system. So I used API chat Deputy API to four question answering and also for text classification and if you talk about the transfer learning and fine-tune, so I use that in computer vision projects. That was I told you about the classification project. So which were the helmet classification so where I use the affectionate before model as a base model and if more layers and if you find that model and use for my model and I use another model for the detection model and that was the YOLO. I used the YOLO as a base model and I that was the base model and I retrained my model on that my data on that and that was the waist detection. That was the garbage detection model. So in that we gave those six and seven six classes which were cup glass can plastic so that these were the classes. So in that class we have we use YOLO button model. And we again the idea is to three class three layers on that and we retrain that model on our own data to get a very good accuracy. So we got a very good accuracy on the list data because we already have a trend model it may that was trained on images. So YOLO would be very good choice very good choice that time.

"It's great to hear about your hands-on experience with YOLO and Faster R-CNN, and the real-world challenges you've encountered. Addressing occlusion and class imbalance is crucial for practical applications. Can you elaborate on the strategies you've used or are considering to mitigate these issues, particularly the class imbalance problem, which is quite common in machine learning tasks?","Exactly. So first of all, we have to do data augmentation to do to solve the problem of class imbalance. Then we have employed various strategies new strategies in which we have used couple of what we can say extracting new features from the images which have prohibited items. So our main task would be to first of all find the images which have prohibited items in them. And then we will try to focus more upon them. So we will be using attention mechanism to do this and to remove the background tribe tribals, then let's imagine we have 100 images. What we will do is we will pay each and every image with each other so they will be 100 C2 combinations of these images and will try to what we can say find out the features from each of them so that they will focus upon the similarities and dissimilarities between the images which have the prohibited items. So in this way, we will be solving the we will be having a lot of features new features specially so this will solve the data augmentation problem or the class and balance problem. So and we are employing new techniques like few short and 0 short learning so and apart from that regarding the task of occlusion problem. We are trying to go towards the what we can say counter based learning and cascaded learning recently. We have seen that a lot of research papers are employing this technique and specially the counter bass problems contest learning. So in the counter based learning, we will be employing attention mechanism and transform visual Transformer learning, which will help us to solve the occlusion problem. Thank you.",4,3

It was hard because every resume is different in a way how, it's designed in a as an So the the in order to understand the model, like, where the experiences is, It was little bit hard in the beginning as I was the, new intern there, and it was a new start up. Everything was from the beginning. So, I after couple of weeks, I learned, how to point out the that experiences, and I use the tokenizer in that model in order to understand, each word.

"No worries, it's all part of the learning process. Let's pivot to your project on disease identification in newborns. You mentioned using a Vision Transformer and GPT-2. Can you explain how you integrated these two models and the specific challenges you encountered with model integration?","Definitely. So this was the first time that I had I was working with like NLP or natural language processing projects. So first of all, our aim of the project was to form a report by seeing the images of the patients like newborn patients and images of through images identify. What are the symptoms it may have and with rest with respect to the symptoms. What causes it may have so I need to form a report. So basically the project aims to combine the computer vision and help you. So basically what I did is first I started with a very simple approach to learn the basics of the project like for encoding for the encoding part of this project. I used the convolutional neural network to encode the model and for the decoder. I used the simple RNN Network. No problem with this was like it cannot form a long first. RNN has a Vanishing gradient problem and exploding gradient problem. It cannot form a long sentences effectively. So then I proceeded to lstm like encoding with CNN and then decoding with lstm which result than the previous one but still was not very effective. So then I researched and found something called attention again, so then I used attention mechanism. And then move to the Transformer part then so later. I use both Transformers like Vision Transformers for encoding and GPT model for decoding. So this is how I solve the problem. And this was a journey, which I went in this project.",2,3
"That sounds like a solid high-level approach. Let's delve a bit deeper into some aspects of your solution. Given your experience, what potential challenges or constraints do you foresee in implementing this machine learning pipeline for detecting and predicting maintenance issues in solar panels?","Okay. So one major challenge was that, the data capturing process process needs to be focused. Like, when we want to have a good ortho mosaic, it should have a certain degree of overlap. Like, a 40 degree side overlap and oh, sorry, 40% side overlap. And 40% or 50%, those, front overlap. So that was something that is the kind of not, in our control. It's a bit it's on the field team. So that was one of the challenge that we faced. Another was the the drifter problem. So initially, what we had seen was, once we have trained our model and put it into production, the thing was, it it was performing very well on, our training set that we had trained the model on, even on the validation set, which the model had not seen. But once we put it into the production, the new also that were coming in, they had very poor performance. So we wanted to understand what was the reason. So that's why we had implemented that dip drift detection system. So once we see there once we observed that there was significant drift in the training data that we had. And the latest data that we are currently getting, So we were able to pinpoint that where exactly the problem. So the problem was the field team had upgraded their drones for to a newer version, which are kind of better, and, we're able to capture high quality images. But, we were not aware that. And, we had, basically trained our model on the old image set, which was, a different drone than what the 3rd field team was currently loading. So that's when we realized that this was a problem, and so we retrained the model on that part. On the auto and images, from this new set of images by newer newer one. So yeah. So one of the challenges was, that knowing everything about data, how the data was connected. That was one of the crucial thing that I understood and will remember. Hopefully, in future, that, we also need to be aware of data collection process. So this was all one of the main problems, that we had faced. Yeah. So not too much. Rest everything kind of went smooth. And the preprocessing and experimenting with GSD to understand how the, that bounding box effect is affecting by its dimension were affected by GST. That was another thing that, we had to initially faced talent, but then we understood that, yeah, DSD is something that we also need to focus on. So, yeah, that's all I believe. Those are the challenges that face. That's it.",4,3
"Your experience with the flexibility of PyTorch for granular control over the training process, especially with callbacks and custom logic, is a key advantage that many practitioners appreciate. Given this preference for PyTorch in certain situations, how do you ensure that the models you develop are still scalable and can be efficiently deployed in production, considering that TensorFlow is often the framework of choice for production environments due to its static graph execution and optimization capabilities?",I can disagree I disagree here because I have used python the diploma and it has worked to work well for me for deployment model versioning. the only reason is I have full control over it so I can change the code whatever way I like to if tensorflow can do it. Pattern also do it all you have to do the only difference that to write the code. There is only overhead is what I can see but apart from that as for a deployment is concerned support is also there for pytorch. So yeah.,1,2
"It seems like you were about to explain the concept of 1NF (First Normal Form) and how it involves dividing data into separate tables to eliminate duplicate information.

This is all using the normalization techniques. And once the database is not having any duplicates and everything, then we can write a query to retrieve that, and the query can be query performance can be increased if at all the database database has no redundancy or or repetition values. So that's what my point. My point is, like, increasing the efficiency or in, making the database tables will help us in, retrieving the better queries.",1,2
"Using Docker with FastAPI for model deployment is a solid approach, and it's great to hear that you're considering scalability with technologies like Kubernetes and message queues. Shifting gears a bit, I noticed you've worked on a project for pseudocode to code generation using NLP. Can you discuss the challenges you faced in this project, particularly in ensuring that the generated code was both syntactically correct and functionally accurate?","Shirt, so in this particular project the entire aim was to make sure that we do pseudocode to Coeur translation. to a good extent in the similar to the performance of llms, but without the computational cost of lnms so we ended up taking a very Low level approach we did not use any large language models. The views are decision tree and we used a simple lstm for Generation. So this just kind of three different phases first is the this one copy phase in this week copy all the tokens from the solo code which can be directly put in the code. For example, you have you know, sort of code you have let's say set variable X to 3. So X is something that can be directly copied. So we make sure that we Mark that as you know, this is something that can be copied. and then we use lstm to generate the code version of the suit of court, but with masks where we can take the copy tokens that we have generated. Later on the combined phase is where we take this. sentence that our lstm generated with masked tokens and we combine them with our Copy tokens, which have been generated by the decision tree. So for the final output, so what we realize here is this was in public elements not exactly better. But the performance is just there near the area performance, but for a fraction of its compute cost. Right and the challenges we Face Expressway while making sure the code is functional. syntactically, correct is obviously the first thing was we'll have to every time we ended up running the code later on once the generated it and we had errors to make sure what was going around where the issue was and retain the lstm. So what we figured out was the most problem was when the lstm which was having issues with translating the court to one from Sudoku to court and the copy Facebook was doing pretty great. So what we ended up doing was we ended up being sure the lstm generation was way better. So we focused on that we gave it more data. We tried it on this is well, so it's a little bit more generalized. we increase the Window and we tried by STM. We tried a few different things. Ah, finally by worked and the reason it worked here lstm better than llms is because the core we database we were working with was maximum 100 times of Court, which means that we would have to worry about forgetting and long context windows.",4,3

We have the alert system with us. We have the elk setup here. So whenever so we have this Cron job with us, we have different microservices. One of them is wrong time. So when when we when there is a let's say request to Aquin article or recommend a system from the client. We set up a crown for every two days or every three days for the with the customers requirement. So with that Cron job, it basically does is it it trains the data on if it was time it takes on hold it not so it pushes a message to the cop car then Kafka triggers the bad job and with the bad job if the bad job is completed. So we have we are maintaining logs and then the bad job is or is submitted when the batch of his being run versus the State of the bad job on which for which documents the batch of his already done. We have this alerting system and the batch of his completed we get an alert let the batch of this client is completed you can check so we all have the system to be plus.

Where I got to work with the tensorflow.",1,2
I appreciate your explanation of how CNNs work for image classification tasks. Could you now describe a scenario where you would use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) in a computer vision application and explain how you would evaluate the performance of the GAN?,"Wow, so in a generative adversarial neural network, there are two things there is a generator and then there is a discriminator. So given us given some noise the generator generates a fake sample and the discriminator discriminates whether this sample which is generated whether it is fake or real. So there are two networks, which are trained simultaneously and the point when the Gen when the discriminator is not able to discriminate discriminate between the real and the fake sample is when we tell the generator is working really well, right. So that's when the Gan is actually working.",2,3
"Interesting approach, especially using traditional ML algorithms for a project that typically involves deep learning. Now, let's pivot to some technical skills-based questions. Given your experience with TensorFlow, could you explain the difference between a TensorFlow constant and a TensorFlow variable, and in what scenarios you would use each one?",so tensorflow constant would be,1,3
"I appreciate the clarification regarding your previous role. Given your current focus on AI and machine learning for tasks like traffic light recognition and LLM-based caption generation, could you elaborate on the specific challenges you faced when optimizing the stable diffusion models for smartphone execution? How did you approach these challenges, and what were the key outcomes in terms of model performance and efficiency?","So, basically, stable diffusion has been popular, recently because of its multiple applications. So we started with optimizing stable distribution decision for text to image generation, project. So where, the user gives a prompt and, the model helps in generating the images as per the prompt. So, basically, the stabilization models they are iterative ones, and then they take multiple steps and, it may lead to delay. So what we try to do is we try to optimize the model so that, it can be executed at a shorter span instead of generating from the seed. So we'll be able to achieve the output, the desired output. That is the image which was requested by the user using a prompt. And once the output is applied, obtained, it'll be displayed. So, basically, we try to compress the model so that it can run on any smartphones. Because Oppo being a smartphone company, our target was to compress the model, quantize it, basically, and try to execute on the smartphone.",2,3
"I see, that's a crucial step for ensuring the relevance of the responses. Shifting focus a bit, could you elaborate on the model architecture you used for the computer vision system to prevent accidents in warehouses during your internship at Optisol Business Solutions? What led you to choose that particular architecture?","Yeah for forklift safety automation. We have used several pre-trained competition models like yellow and efficient that d0 model and other other models, but specifically for the efficient at d 0 so it will reduce the false positives and false negatives in that particular scenario since the folk of a real-time one. So if the person is present in that, but it failure to detect the person it might end up with an accident for the purpose. We have to reduce both the false positive and false negative. So if you consider this the efficient at d0 model is more efficient in that and we just retrained or a fine tune with the particular model for directing the forklift because the efficient at model is trying to Coco data set which does not contain the class called forklift for the purpose. We retrain the official model and it or production is a it is build upon the efficient model and upon the they have used to the buy Polar classifier upon the which is more effective on",3,2
"Your approach to deploying a sentiment analysis model with Flask is well thought out, especially with the emphasis on preloading the model and minimizing request overhead. The use of caching mechanisms is also a smart way to improve performance. Given your experience with deploying machine learning models, how do you monitor the performance of these models in production, and what tools or practices do you use to detect and address issues that may arise over time, such as model drift or degradation?","Sure. So after the model is deployed the final task is to determine the performance of the model in the deployment. So this for this starts we have automated processes that involves a series of tasks. So in order to illustrate, this tasks the first task that comes to my mind is",1,3
"Using GPT-based models for post-OCR correction is a smart choice. When you're integrating the GPT API for text correction, how do you ensure that the corrections are contextually relevant, especially when dealing with technical or domain-specific content like mathematical expressions? And could you also explain how you manage the computational resources for running these large language models in a production environment?","like we are the Grammatical correction I am using like mostly the OCR output is almost correct. It sometimes gives spelling errors and and all those things. So the output is after the OCR ring is already very correct, but sometimes due to these chemicals only they are small errors. So that's why it's able to use them. I mean able to use llm to collect them. So the sentence is already in place before giving it to the llm only small collections are needed and the computational about the computational resources like the API like the this whole it does not require a lot of this like the the API. I think you and we are not doing it for lots of text because we we will once once we have process one video then we will install it and store it and use it. So it's like it's it's not the feature that we are developing is not something which will be like for public. It will be for our internal use like we will use a lot of videos and create and store the questions so that like all or Page at Tech based platform. So it the questions stored in HTML will be used for use for creating tests for the students. So the computational resources are not very high because we are not using it for public not giving for the public domain view. We will be using internally.",1,2
Sure. What opportunities for future enhancements or expansions do you see for this sentiment analysis tool?,"So enhancing the sentiment analysis tool can take various forms focusing on improving, that accuracy, expanding functionality, and adapting to new language and domains.",2,3
"Exploring the potential of LoRa adapters for optimizing large foundation models like LLMs and stable diffusion is indeed a promising direction for future work. Given this focus on cutting-edge optimization techniques, how do you approach staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in AI and machine learning, and how do you decide which techniques are worth exploring further for your projects?","Basically, we keep on monitoring the, research that's going on here, and as everyone knows, yeah, is ever developed, developing area, and people are publishing a lot. And, we try to follow most of the, open source solutions like HuggingPACE and other portals and see, like, whatever models are updated or whatever white papers are published in multiple conferences. And if they're relevant to our application, for example, ours is mostly bringing models into the smartphone, so we try to, explore more and read articles related to that.",2,3
"That's a fascinating application of computer vision for identifying medicinal plants. Given your experience with deploying models, could you walk me through how you utilized GCP for deploying your model, and what specific services or tools you found most useful in that process?",In gcp I we regularly use vertex AI to deploy the models. in vertex AI sometimes we use automl services or sometimes we use our custom models. And deploy the endpoints and then just give the API to the development team in the back ends.,2,3
"Great! I see from your resume that you've worked on AI solutions for financial models at Riskfuel. Can you walk me through the approach you took to develop and deploy these AI solutions, particularly in terms of the models you chose and the challenges you faced with deployment?","Up, right? So the models that I developed for risk fuel corresponded to financial asset pricing or non-standard vanilla options effectively. What we did was we would replace a Monte Carlo based pricer for a bank with a regression based or a standard rectangular and that for basically solving a regression problem. What would happen is is that because it's not because it is neural network-based. It was extremely fast compared to a Monte Carlo based Chrysler and because of the matrix multiplication and nonlinear activation functions, which are easily parallelizable. You can reduce computation time from let's say a few minutes for each option price down to like less than 70 milliseconds the types of training or the models that we worked on were resnet models with residual skip connections or if we had to do generative modeling. We use something called a variational auto encoder.",5,3
"It's clear that you've delved deep into the NLP process, using RNNs with TF-IDF vectorization and implementing cross-validation for model evaluation. The high accuracy you achieved is commendable. Now, shifting focus to your C++ experience, can you describe a complex problem you solved in C++ and the specific features or aspects of the language that you found most beneficial in addressing that problem?","Okay, so like using the C plus plus programming language, I actually have done data structures in algorithms. Like I had solved some like there were some problems solving questions related to that from which like the platform like such as gfg lead code and hacker rank. It's on multiple questions of data structures and algorithm particularly what some what tricky was solving the linked list questions using the C plus plus which was tricky as well as interesting. So the problem that I founded the most difficult or I say a complex and tricky voice as far as I remember with finding out the middle of the linked list when you are given a starting in the ending of the linked list. So how to find out that Middle English using C-Class. Plus I had soldered particular Problem and I found it interesting as well and it involved all the all the important concepts of linked lists and C plus plus basic programming. Oh involving the syntax of C plus plus and how to use the linked list structure how to implement that linked list structure on how to just extract that middle part of the node from the huge linked list that is given to you. So yeah, it was all done or done through C plus plus programming language and they were various multiple problems as well that I had solved through C plus plus also I am having a three star in C plus plus and hackerrank platform and five star from python in the in data structures in",2,3
"I see, so you used existing Docker images. That's a common approach. Shifting focus to your machine learning experience, you mentioned working on a Stroke Prediction project. Could you elaborate on how you utilized NoSQL databases in this project, and why you chose NoSQL over a traditional SQL database?",In my project stroke prediction. I have not used any database. I have used a different machine learning models given a dataset my task was to present. Predict whether the person will have stroke or not based on the given parameters. So I just applied machine learning models on this data set and I do not use any. database in this project,1,2
"Absolutely, recognizing and rewarding contributions can be a powerful motivator. Shifting focus to your technical skills, you've mentioned proficiency in Java, Python, and front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Can you describe a project where you integrated back-end functionality in Java or Python with a front-end interface, and what were the key challenges you faced in this integration?","He's always nice. Like it is always nice to talk about this project my current favorites so I can say the project. I've been working recently with my department friends from various different streams. Like UI ux the project name is Nutri suggest this Nutri suggest is basically a project which is based on providing the users the correct diet plan the correct tailored diet plan for them related to their health condition. Let's say in India or in apart across the world and many people are facing many health conditions. Let's say hi obesity higher or let's say BP sugar and kind of many like pcod kind of health conditions where actually died plays a very important role in them apart from medications medication can only restrict and you know, can I only little or little effect it can create on? In longer and prevention of the health condition and the main routes of the health condition license what you intake so intake is very necessary is one of my friend in your ux has been facing such problem so we could sit into together and discussing. about how will an ml project a machine learning project which could recognize patterns of health conditions use their input user provides and able to actually filter the search and provide them with the correct diet plan where actually the user can See what died to follow what of plan what plan of action to follow what day to take it what time this is all this ambiguity in the diet plans. If you search it on Google it is not reliable like one the different opinions on how what diet plan to follow but we have tailored the diet plan into such a way by the way from taking the diets from various different articles approaching real life dietitians. We have integrated the real life dietitians into the application where they can interview user can interact with the dedication directly call them. So Nutrisystem such an application where user gives his personal information trusting the application because the application is not just a doctor but a friend whose together with you until you make your ailment into an aide. So this is where like we have been participating in many hackathons with the same project and we've been seeing fruits like their ideas been like many people because this is a real time situation. Everybody's almost facing current so It can be able to supplication using. As a backend we have used python for the machine learning. So and we have used for frontend. Part so with HTML CSS bootstrap and react JS is done with one of my one of my friend and Android development has been under progress. We use. This is a web application, but we wanted to do we want to make it a mobile application also. So what we have me personally in the last semester, I've been working in the front end part. I've been building the interface the UI and the application my friend from UI ux team. We are actually a team of three. So my friend of your extreme was working on the figma about creating how the user experience is it so they have a very good can chat. We have a very good flowchart. We have real-time service with the user how they feel about the application. So we've been working on making this idea patent. Also by the university has been like guiding us to make this idea into a patent. and we've been like the challenges we face in this project was to actually this is an huge domain where they can they can be many adults to this project. They can be many additional input. So we are always open to input their always open to make changes. So we're actually Trying to build an application where it gives the best kind of plan of action to the user which user can follow and which is not also which is also budget friendly. I cannot give you a very expensive diet which you cannot afford so it should be a neutral one and it should be very effective to the user. So this is a project we've been working on like and talking about Services. We've been used AWS. Also this pro-life project where I've been deploying it in AWS has really helped me learn about cloud services have been doing a training in Java back on development and also AWS training currently. I'm like preparing for the AWS associate. Architect certificate also so it has been helping me to actually learn how the real time cloud services who work like S3 ec2 about the cloudfront about the global accelerator about how the kubernetes service the eks works with the fire Firebase. So how they elastic file system or the EBS are let's say any kind of security things like AWS Mackey, which actually works on machine learning patterns to give provide us and stiffly protect sensitive information.talking about the project backend back in is actually integrated with the reacts with the back end where we are using spring boot, so It is like it is well integrated project but it is full-fledged. It is not completely full fledged because we've been working on different different parts and we are small team. So they're actually making progress each day and make actually able to just don't expect you to deploy it will prepared. So the Prototype is actually ready.",2,3
"Navigating the complexity of defining routes, especially in the context of a chatbot project, can indeed be challenging.

"It's good to hear that you have hands-on experience with AWS services like EC2, Docker, and SageMaker, and that you've been involved in CI/CD pipelines and model deployment. Since you mentioned your work with NLP Transformer models, can you tell me about the research project you did on understanding idioms in these models? What were the key challenges and findings from that project?","Yeah, great question. So the project that I was doing was a research project solely based on, you know understanding how and to what extent Transformers, you know process idioms. So idioms Have non-literal meanings. So for example, if somebody says kick the bucket the meaning of the idiom translates to somebody dying rather than somebody literally clicking a bucket so things like that are very context-based and as we know transform our specialty some, you know, initial Farmers like bird, they are they might not be very good at recognizing the hidden meaning of the words. So I read a good amount of research papers on what people did and stuff like that. So I am employed. I actually perform two experiments as part of a project. The first was seeing whether the Transformers understand idioms as part of a language or as a no Downstream tasks, right? So to this extent we employed something called adapters. So adapters are, you know Common these days but back then it was something really new. So we used a framework called Maddox, so it was made by even Village from Cambridge. So we provide language adapters and tasks adapters towards learning whether the idiom the potentially idiomatic phrase in the sentence was used in a literal sense or idiomatic sense. So the data set was a binary data set. And the Transformer was, you know trained and evaluated to predict whether the potentially idiomatic phrase was used in literal sense or you know idiomatic sense. So this data set of multilingual Portuguese plus English. So to understand how Transformers, you know, understand this. So I trained the, you know Transformer to identify idiomatic meaning in English then evaluated it on Portuguese and the same way. I trained it on Portuguese and evaluated evaluated it on English, so if the Transformer learns how to recognize idioms as a downstream task the transfer across languages would be high.Um considering we have language adapters just for understanding the language. So the only task essentially is to understand how to or what to do to identify the idioms, right? So, so I give me one minute. Sorry. Yeah, so the result was that the transfer was not really good. So training it on English did not translate well into Portuguese so that experiment really concluded that idioms and their idiomatic meanings are lit are really learned as a part of a language rather than So that was the first experiment that I bought from. My second experiment is you know.",4,3
Please go ahead and outline the prioritized plan for implementing these future enhancements.,"Like, enhanced personalization, and there's a milestone 1 which in which enabled so enhanced personalization real time data retrieval, improved context awareness, advanced analytics and insights, multimodal input output, natural language understanding improvements, integration with external tools, interact interactive tutorial and learning modules, in which there are milestone 1 and milestone 2. Like, in enhanced personalization, in milestone 1, we have to enable users to save preferences and interaction history. And in the milestone 2, we have to develop a memory feature to remember past interaction and context for better responses. And if you talk about, like, real time data retrieval, there is a milestone 1 in which we have to integrate the APIs for real time data, like weathers, news, and stock prices. And the milestone too, we have to expand API integration. To include a wider range of data source. In the improved context awareness, there is a milestone 1 in which we have to enhance the contextual retention capability within single sessions And in the milestone 2, we have to develop mechanisms for context retention across multiple sessions. And if you talk about the advanced analytics and insights, then there is a milestone 1 in which implement basic data analysis and visualization tools is there. And in the milestone 2, we have to introduce predictive analytics and more complex data processing capabilities. So, similarly, these are these works with other points also. By following these prioritized plan, each milestone builds on the previous 1, ensuring a structured and efficient implementation of enhancements that progressively and add more value to the tool. That's all.",2,3
"Prioritizing frameworks with robust documentation and error-handling capabilities is a wise strategy for ensuring a smooth and reliable conversion process. How do you typically approach troubleshooting and resolving technical issues, and how has this approach contributed to your problem-solving skills?","So like whenever we have any error, like we cannot try to look out into the stack Overflow like where where other people have waste dissimilar issue. So is that like we can able to get any resolution from those things? Like whether particular issues are being able to solve or not or it's like we can we can go to the GitHub issues page like where the directly we can mention our issue if it is not listed out if it is already started we can check like what is the solution but that the package is going to improve it in questions are like we can or else make we can also check these and anywhere near the way to modify the documentation like coding presentation inside the package like says that we can work from the error. So like by using this like this weighs like we can and then we can check any is there any medium articles",1,2
"It's great that you experimented with different models and focused on feature engineering to improve the sentiment analysis. Given that Random Forest performed the best, can you describe a specific instance where a feature you engineered had a significant impact on the model's performance? What was the feature, and how did you determine its importance in the context of sentiment analysis?","Okay, so it in the Feature Part, it was the employees. Let's say the data that employee review it was a sentence. So in that case we had to find out the negative words and stop words that for the cleaning and for negative words were mostly related to the sentiment being negative. So in that case, sometimes the negative words could affect the data and that's where we had to do the feature engine and giving and tuning the features that way.",2,3
