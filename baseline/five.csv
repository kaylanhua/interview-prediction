211,5,"Great! Let's dive into the case study. Imagine you are working for a company that manages a large network of solar farms. Your task is to develop an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to detect and predict maintenance issues in solar panels, leveraging your expertise in machine learning and cloud technologies. The goal is to reduce manual inspection efforts and improve the efficiency of the maintenance process. To start, can you propose a high-level solution architecture or approach to tackle this problem?","Okay. So the first thing okay. It's kind of exactly problem statement that we are trying to solve. So the first thing is we have a dedicated field team, which basically, flies the drone and get all the images. Once we get all the images of the solar power plant, we particularly use thermal images. Once we get all thermal images of the solar power plant, we take that up. We process them. So, basically, processing means we use photogrammetry to generate the complete view of this, solar power plant. And once we have the complete view of the solar power plant, we based on our historical data that we had we initially had and we had already manually processed it for this, detecting the solar issues, like, we will have bounding boxes corresponding to each ortho mosaic. What we'll do is we take this, orthos, and we take the their corresponding, detections. Bounding boxes, you can say. And then we create a chunk of all these, this complete auto, we take create a chunk of this and create an image dataset with corresponding bounding boxes. Once we have those bounding boxes, what we'll do is we select, more, different models. So model selection for object detection, we can use different models. Like, we can use R CNN, faster R CNN. And, then we have new single shot detection models like YOLO and so we can use those things. So which are the latest is YOLO where it's that's why we proceeded to the yellow beard. And, after that, once we get the dataset prepared and we have preprocessed images like like I had said. We don't want a lot of noise that's why we converted it to grayscale images. And we have also used Wallace filter to make sure the contrast is in. And, oh, yeah. One more thing. So when we do fly or drawn itself, we need something named as, GSD. So GSD is the distance, global sampling distance. So what it means is that, how much meters a single pixel represents. So we have normalized that GSD also so that, model find its e find it easier to map those pixels, and there is not too much of a a difference among the autos even though the capturing process capturing of image process was different or something, you could say, and not the at the same GST. Okay. So once we have trained the model, what we can do is, we can evaluate the model based on whatever previous methods that we had for detection. Marking the solar issues. And, we can compare its performance with our model. And once we see that the the, of model performs better than what we previously had, We can simply put that model into production.",3,True,"['Response 1 is better', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 2 is better']"
273,5,"Absolutely, please go ahead and complete your explanation of the second experiment. It's important to understand the full scope of your research and how it informed your approach to NLP challenges.","Thank you, very good. So my second experiment involved something called Mirror Vic. So that was a fine tuning technique, which is closely related to language modeling which forces the model to identify deeper meanings of words. Okay. So what we do is we you know, We actually Target a single word in a sentence to learn the deeper, meaning of then mask some random other words in the same sentence and then, you know try to get a word in context representation of the word or a word in context embedding of the word. So the embedding of the word but in that context, right so this concept I extended it to idioms. So I I replace idioms with a single, you know new token that I personally created. So because that's a research that shows that idioms are treated independently other than you know pieces, you know, idioms are handled as independent tokens rather than you know, aggregate of other words, right? That is how Transformers usually try to learn ads and that is how humans actually understand. And idioms also, so I first introduced a single token in place of the idiom and then try to learn the meaning of it through this mirror week technique. So in the where we technique what we did was I masked the idiom token. Okay, so I masked the idiom token. And then tried to learn the meaning of it through context. Okay, so if the idiom is used in if the idiomatic phase potentially idiomatic phrase is used in a non-literal sense, then the embedding of it would be very different than when the idiom is used in a literal sense. Right? So we find it for language modeling using contrastive learning described in the middle and we found that it really really helps in. Let's say magnifying the performance of bird or you know, extending or increase in the performance of bird towards understanding idioms. So that was a very interesting. Mind and it really did you know. Help increase the recognition of idioms in Transformer models. So first experiment was to understand how not Transformers actually treat idioms as a part of a task or as part of language then the second experiment was to try to improve the performance of the model towards understanding idioms. That concludes my project. And thank you.",4,True,"['Response 1 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 1 is better']"
365,5,"Creating a custom metric that aligns with the specific needs of your project is a smart approach. It's clear that you're focused on real-world performance. Shifting gears a bit, I noticed you also have experience with NLP and large language models. Can you discuss a project where you worked with NLP, particularly with large language models, and how you addressed any challenges related to model size or training data?","Okay. All right. So NLP something which I which I love to do. I'm pretty I'm pretty confident to say that I am I have been doing this for the past few years. And for the past one year. I've been doing a lot of llm projects. So I'm pretty confident about the skill and I would love to talk more about this. You can ask any question in it. So yeah coming to your question the model size and training right? So model size as you said, you know this these are large language models and these models are pretty large. Let's say we have Falcon we have Mr. We have mixture now and now there are a lot of 70b models. So the model size is determined by the the parameter the parameters how many parameters the model has so there are seven billion model. There are 35 billion parameter models and they are 70 billion parameter models also. So we were in Middle where we were trying to do the 13th parameter model of llama. So we were using this. Kind of model and yeah, this is these are pretty large and how do we do it? How do we store in our own GPU is we do the quantization technique where we tried to sew one Precision is 32 bit float. What we did is we quantize this model to 4 bit so that we can reduce the memory for that large language model and try to optimize it and even though if we reduce these many Precision points, the accuracy was almost as far as the full precision. So we didn't also lose accuracy. Maybe there is a 0.1% of accuracy decreased but that really doesn't much matter because we wanted much more speeder and lighter kind of a model. That's how we deal with all these things and coming to training training these large language model. There are different accepts of there are a lot of different, you know ways to do it one is parameter efficient tuning test. There is Laura where we use Laura then there is Q Laura then there is I am also doing this there is supervised fine-tuning and there is also this DPO which is direct preference optimization. I have done a lot of a lot of These Fine tunings and trainings on top of it. So there are a lot of free training so which we use but we didn't pre-train the whole model because these models take a lot of time to train. So what we did is we try to take the already pre-trained model and we find tuned on top on top of it for our custom use case. So that's what we did.",3,True,"['Response 1 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 1 is better']"
510,5,Great! I see from your resume that you've worked on a project involving one-shot learning for medical image analysis. Could you walk me through the approach you took for this project and how you implemented it using TensorFlow?,"Sure, so the current problem that I faced doing that particular time was we had a particular data set of value of just a few hundred of labeled data set for something called chromosome analysis. So we had to build a model for classification regarding that so we couldn't go with the conventional class CNN because the problem is with such less dated always under fits and it's very difficult to generalize and the option that I took was going with contrastive learning. Which turned out to be very well at good and generalizing compared to a CNN based approach. So the approach is very simple. We had around 100 100 to 200 label data. So I built a service network, which is basically two Networks. Of the same network. So what this does is it takes an image as an input and gives you an output as an embedding. And the idea is that you give it pairs of images sometimes even triplet if you using triplet loss. So I used to close in this case. So it took three images One images called anchor image. The other image is an image, which is similar to this anchor image, right? The other image is something that's not so it's not the same classes jacket image. So what it does is it tries to create embeddings such that the distance or The euclidean distance you can say between the embeddings of the ones in the same class is minimized and the embedded distance between the embeddings of the ones and the different class is a maximized. So at the end when you convert an image with a Samus Network into embedding space it tries to minimize the distance between inter-class and Max is a difference between indoor. inter class so this is how much short learning for you used and the main benefit in this particular thing was that we were able to generalize very well, even though we had a very less data set compared to training a deep CNN which was not able to generalize later on when we got more data Weasley shifted to deep sea animals, but with this limited data one shot learning with Sam's networks worked great.",4,True,"['Response 1 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Comparable']"
663,5,"Great! I see from your resume that you've worked on AI solutions for financial models at Riskfuel. Can you walk me through the approach you took to develop and deploy these AI solutions, particularly in terms of the models you chose and the challenges you faced with deployment?","Up, right? So the models that I developed for risk fuel corresponded to financial asset pricing or non-standard vanilla options effectively. What we did was we would replace a Monte Carlo based pricer for a bank with a regression based or a standard rectangular and that for basically solving a regression problem. What would happen is is that because it's not because it is neural network-based. It was extremely fast compared to a Monte Carlo based Chrysler and because of the matrix multiplication and nonlinear activation functions, which are easily parallelizable. You can reduce computation time from let's say a few minutes for each option price down to like less than 70 milliseconds the types of training or the models that we worked on were resnet models with residual skip connections or if we had to do generative modeling. We use something called a variational auto encoder.",3,True,"['Response 1 is better', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 2 is better']"
