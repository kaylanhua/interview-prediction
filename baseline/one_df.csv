40,1,"It's clear you have a good understanding of indexing strategies. How did you decide which columns to index in your project, and what impact did indexing have on the performance of your queries?",making indexing far clearer.,2,True,"['Response 1 is better', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 2 is better']"
10,1,"Using JMeter for API load testing is a solid approach. Given your experience with microservices architecture, how did you design the communication protocols between the microservices to ensure efficient and reliable data exchange, especially in a high-traffic scenario?","So we have utilized the, APIs endpoints and, the controllers we have as mentioned, have user risk controllers and the services are specifically, given the business, things capsulated between them, and we wrote the controllers that accept the, request given by the clients and the the response can be the controllers make use of the services, and then they will be, giving the, response to the client.",2,True,"['Response 1 is better', 'Comparable', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 1 is better']"
604,1,"Given your experience with integrating Python and SQL for AI/ML projects, how did you handle large datasets in terms of efficiency and what strategies did you use to ensure the performance of your Python scripts remained optimal?","Us so when we talk about python, I just worked with a python Spyder. I was using as IDE after that to store the data I was using SQL which contains all the data, which we were importing to python as a DB file after that. We were using some inputs from CAD generated, which was in the form of Excel or these kind of input. I was storing in the Excel or DB and we were importing to Python and we were getting the image plotted by the help of matplot. Thank you.",2,True,"['Response 1 is better', 'Comparable', 'Response 1 is better', 'Comparable', 'Comparable']"
17,1,"You've given a clear distinction between Docker and Kubernetes, highlighting Docker's role in virtualization and resource management, and Kubernetes' focus on container orchestration and management at scale. It's good to see you understand the core concepts of both technologies. Given your experience with these tools, how do you ensure that your Docker containers are secure, and could you mention any best practices you follow when building Docker images?","Oh, I'm not work on Docker security. But yeah, when I push my images to Docker Hub, I keep in mind that my login ID and password are not shared with any inappropriate user. So that's the only security I used. Also. I have also used some security security purpose in my application. For example in my project in my nodejs project. What I've done is I have used a key and I have put them in a DOT EnV file. So that cannot be patched know from application since I put them in file. So security is provided in my application. Oh, yeah.",2,True,"['Response 1 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 1 is better']"
598,1,"It seems like you were about to explain how you applied hashing or B-tree indexing in a specific assignment to optimize a query. Could you provide a detailed example of the query you optimized, the indexing strategy you chose, and the before-and-after performance metrics to illustrate the effectiveness of your approach?",hashing techniques.,2,True,"['Response 1 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 1 is better']"
