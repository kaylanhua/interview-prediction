      "Good Response:\n",
      "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which are instances of classes. These objects can contain data in the form of attributes and code in the form of methods. OOP focuses on encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Encapsulation involves bundling data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit. Inheritance allows new classes to be created based on existing classes, enabling code reuse. Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling flexibility in the design. Abstraction hides the complexity of the internal implementation of objects, allowing users to interact with them through an interface. OOP promotes modularity, reusability, and extensibility in software development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bad Response:\n",
      "Object-oriented programming is when you use objects to write code. It's like making a blueprint for your software, but instead of drawing it, you create objects that do stuff. It's kind of like putting Legos together to build something, except the Legos are your code. So, yeah, OOP is just about using objects to make your programs.\n",

      "\n",
      "Good Response:\n",
      "Recursion in programming is a technique where a function calls itself in its definition. This allows a function to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, self-similar subproblems, ultimately reaching a base case where the solution is known. Recursion is particularly useful for solving problems that can be naturally divided into similar subproblems, such as tree traversal or factorial calculation.\n",

      "Recursion is when you use a loop inside a function to keep repeating until a condition is met. It's like a loop but fancier, I guess.\n",

      "HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transmitting data over the internet. It operates on port 80 and sends data in plain text, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of HTTP that uses encryption to protect data. It operates on port 443 and uses SSL/TLS protocols to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.\n",

      "Bad Response:\n",

      "Good Response:\n",
      "Design patterns in software development are reusable solutions to common problems that occur in software design. They are general solutions that have been successfully used in the past and can be applied to new problems. Design patterns help developers communicate about common problems and solutions, improve code readability, and promote code reusability. Some examples of design patterns include Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Strategy patterns.\n",

      "Bad Response:\n",
      "Design patterns in software development are like trendy clothes for code. They're just fancy ways to write code that look cool but don't really do much. You can think of them as shortcuts for lazy developers who don't want to write original code. In reality, design patterns are unnecessary and just make the code more complicated.\n",

      "\n",
      "Good Response:\n",
      "Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the asymptotic behavior of an algorithm as the input size approaches infinity. It helps in analyzing the efficiency and performance of algorithms by providing an upper bound on the worst-case scenario of time or space complexity. For example, if an algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), it means the worst-case time required is proportional to the square of the input size. Big O notation categorizes algorithms into different complexity classes such as O(1) for constant time, O(log n) for logarithmic time, O(n) for linear time, O(n^2) for quadratic time, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bad Response:\n",
      "Big O notation is a way to measure how big a program is. The bigger the O, the bigger the program. It's like a grade for algorithms, where the bigger the grade, the bigger the algorithm is. So, if an algorithm has a Big O of O(n^2), it means the algorithm is squared in size. Just remember, big O means big algorithm.\n",
