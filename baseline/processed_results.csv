Could you dive deeper into the process of retraining YOLO for your specific use case, including any challenges you faced with data annotation or model convergence, and how you addressed those challenges?","Actually more YOLO was very very good model. And you also have a series like V 0 to V right now we 7 is going on. So you also have having a series of YOLO models. We used YOLO before we fight so we did not get like we got the pretend model. So and we had the images of every class is so first thing that we did that we made the five six classes of the and then we resize the images in a particular size like we needed a same size for every every means so we recycled resize the image of this image and after that we Load the pretend data pretend model of YOLO and we train our then we then after that we added two layers two days later to the to the base model of f Smith. and after that we trained but in that we did not do anything more because you know the we had a image and we Images was right. And also yeah, we also did the annotations because when you are when you are using any when you are training any detection model, so for the images you have to have The annotation of that because your model is going to use the notation the notation was your bounding box bounding box the coordinates and also the bounding box coordinates all and also you name of whatever class of that so we have wanted that txt file for that. So me I use the label MZ to annotate the data and we use that they noted data to the YOLO model and we train the model and also we that model so we're going to integrate in the Android device. So the YOLO was in fights. And mobile device is mostly working. Like it's very feasible to a work on the TF Lite model as compared to dot PT because bites were Fighters gave the model in don't pity format. So the ending wanted the model format or flight. So that was very you can say that was a difficult part to change the YOLO model here to to in to TF Lite, but also providing a script for changing the dot PT model to TF Lite like you can export your model in TF Lite former. You don't need to spot your motor dot PT if you are you whether you are using pythons for that. So YOLO, so that time we first we did we changed the road PT model into one and x and we use the openvino to change that model into at 5.

3,What potential trade-offs or compromises might you need to make during the implementation of this real-time object detection system?,"So first, I'll I'll work with a very small dummy model for object detection using a same model to debug. That trade off could be, like, if I use very good model version like YOLO v YOLO v 10, big large version, that accuracy will be very high. But the model will be of too large size and using it on phones or some embedded device would be very difficult, and the latency will be very high. Such hardware support might not be available. So with little decrease in accuracy, we can achieve good, speed and, still have a manageable still have a except sufficient accuracies with that. Like, instead of using more of heavy models with high accuracy, I will try to use some, lightweight models like small version instead of using large version of YOLO. And try to check if the those models are giving sufficient accurate for the production environment. And then I'll compromise I will compromise, high accuracy with a slightly low accuracy, but for faster speed.",4,True,"['Response 1 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 2 is better']"

Given your experience, what potential challenges or constraints do you foresee in implementing this machine learning pipeline for detecting and predicting maintenance issues in solar panels?","Okay. So one major challenge was that, the data capturing process process needs to be focused. Like, when we want to have a good ortho mosaic, it should have a certain degree of overlap. Like, a 40 degree side overlap and oh, sorry, 40% side overlap. And 40% or 50%, those, front overlap. So that was something that is the kind of not, in our control. It's a bit it's on the field team. So that was one of the challenge that we faced. Another was the the drifter problem. So initially, what we had seen was, once we have trained our model and put it into production, the thing was, it it was performing very well on, our training set that we had trained the model on, even on the validation set, which the model had not seen. But once we put it into the production, the new also that were coming in, they had very poor performance. So we wanted to understand what was the reason. So that's why we had implemented that dip drift detection system. So once we see there once we observed that there was significant drift in the training data that we had. And the latest data that we are currently getting, So we were able to pinpoint that where exactly the problem. So the problem was the field team had upgraded their drones for to a newer version, which are kind of better, and, we're able to capture high quality images. But, we were not aware that. And, we had, basically trained our model on the old image set, which was, a different drone than what the 3rd field team was currently loading. So that's when we realized that this was a problem, and so we retrained the model on that part. On the auto and images, from this new set of images by newer newer one. So yeah. So one of the challenges was, that knowing everything about data, how the data was connected. That was one of the crucial thing that I understood and will remember. Hopefully, in future, that, we also need to be aware of data collection process. So this was all one of the main problems, that we had faced. Yeah. So not too much. Rest everything kind of went smooth. And the preprocessing and experimenting with GSD to understand how the, that bounding box effect is affecting by its dimension were affected by GST. That was another thing that, we had to initially faced talent, but then we understood that, yeah, DSD is something that we also need to focus on. So, yeah, that's all I believe.

5,Great! I see from your resume that you've worked on a project involving one-shot learning for medical image analysis. Could you walk me through the approach you took for this project and how you implemented it using TensorFlow?,"Sure, so the current problem that I faced doing that particular time was we had a particular data set of value of just a few hundred of labeled data set for something called chromosome analysis. So we had to build a model for classification regarding that so we couldn't go with the conventional class CNN because the problem is with such less dated always under fits and it's very difficult to generalize and the option that I took was going with contrastive learning. Which turned out to be very well at good and generalizing compared to a CNN based approach. So the approach is very simple. We had around 100 100 to 200 label data. So I built a service network, which is basically two Networks. Of the same network. So what this does is it takes an image as an input and gives you an output as an embedding. And the idea is that you give it pairs of images sometimes even triplet if you using triplet loss. So I used to close in this case. So it took three images One images called anchor image. The other image is an image, which is similar to this anchor image, right? The other image is something that's not so it's not the same classes jacket image. So what it does is it tries to create embeddings such that the distance or The euclidean distance you can say between the embeddings of the ones in the same class is minimized and the embedded distance between the embeddings of the ones and the different class is a maximized. So at the end when you convert an image with a Samus Network into embedding space it tries to minimize the distance between inter-class and Max is a difference between indoor. inter class so this is how much short learning for you used and the main benefit in this particular thing was that we were able to generalize very well, even though we had a very less data set compared to training a deep CNN which was not able to generalize later on when we got more data Weasley shifted to deep sea animals, but with this limited data one shot learning with Sam's networks worked great.",4,True,"['Response 1 is better', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 1 is better']"

So we asked 10 or 15 users who are using the search. So just go through some queries and see how the results are coming and how the results are looking. That's number one second. We have again our road benchmarking system. We have this inbuilt in not inbuilt. We have our custom make algorithm which which we use on some customers data we have their Expected documents in Withers and the like expecting documents for these queries basically the top search results like that.

This includes considerations such as memory usage gpus CPU, utilization and inference speed. Finding and optimization was also a major factor like we explore techniques for fine tuning and optimizing model parameters to improve accuracy while mitigating competition overhead.

Addressing occlusion and class imbalance is crucial for practical applications. Can you elaborate on the strategies you've used or are considering to mitigate these issues, particularly the class imbalance problem, which is quite common in machine learning tasks?","Exactly. So first of all, we have to do data augmentation to do to solve the problem of class imbalance. Then we have employed various strategies new strategies in which we have used couple of what we can say extracting new features from the images which have prohibited items. So our main task would be to first of all find the images which have prohibited items in them. And then we will try to focus more upon them. So we will be using attention mechanism to do this and to remove the background tribe tribals, then let's imagine we have 100 images. What we will do is we will pay each and every image with each other so they will be 100 C2 combinations of these images and will try to what we can say find out the features from each of them so that they will focus upon the similarities and dissimilarities between the images which have the prohibited items. So in this way, we will be solving the we will be having a lot of features new features specially so this will solve the data augmentation problem or the class and balance problem. So and we are employing new techniques like few short and 0 short learning so and apart from that regarding the task of occlusion problem. We are trying to go towards the what we can say counter based learning and cascaded learning recently.

So let's talk about one fine tuning technique, which I am working currently. So there are a lot of different techniques which I did I can cover all of them if you if you are interested, but let's cover one technique which I did which is pretty you know unique in its own way and not people not usually people do that. So what we are trying to do is I'll try to give a domain knowledge what we are trying to I am working for a healthcare to make client where where he just not he wanted the model to not you know, give this medical names. Let's say there are a lot of medicines named Frozen and all so if a chatbot gives all these medication names it can be dangerous and it can so what what should the chatbots says if anyone asked these medical questions the chatbot should say that hey I can advise you, you know, what is the symptoms and conditions, but I cannot, you know advice. Any prescription prescription medicine you have to consult a doctor or some expert for this? So that's why this is the card rail, which we are trying to build in this chatbot. So we find tuned our model to learn this kind of question that if anyone asks, you know about these medicines and all our guardrail is going to get triggered such that it doesn't give the answer and it also gives the right advice to go to you know, the respected. Experts of this field who can give the right advice to the customer to the patient because a doctor can ask hundreds of questions. It understands the history of the of the patient and accordingly all these kind of criteria. It gives a prescribed medicine and we want the best for our patient. That's why we build this card and how did we build this guardrail is we use DP or technique? That's a direct difference optimization technique. How did we build the data set is for building this data sets. We need a question. We need to choose an answer. We need a rejected answer. So the loss function of this DPO is as such that we try to find the model such that the question and the chosen answer. The chosen answer has, you know, we try to increase the chosen answers preference increase the probability of that and decrease the rejected answers probability such that, you know, every time in the user Answer is always set by the this model. And this is how we try to you know, use a free trained model to find tune on top of a clinical data set domain. So and this is one thing let's talk about general, you know, fine tuning of General fine tuning is one instructing and another is you know continuation for fine tuning. So what is continuation and fine tuning in let's say our free training model is not expert in physics. What we can do is we can have lot of physical physics related Wikipedia articles or any articles research papers and all and we can feed it to our pre-trained model such that it can do the next word prediction and it can learn this domain of physics. That's how this is done and coming to the instructor fine tuning technique it that's where you know where the moral can learn to follow an instruction. Not only it understands the physics domain. So, you know understanding some Concepts and domain is one part and the second part is to also the chatbot has to follow the instructions given by the user. That's where instruct fine-tuning comes the data set over there. It looks like where we give the instruction we have a question and we also have an answer in this pattern. It will understand that.

So by using NLP techniques only so we have done tokenization limitations and all the stemming techniques and everything. So after pre-processing, we have played any are techniques so where it can identify the entities, for example, if there is a location where the threat is happening, so it is able to find out the location if it is a technical organization, it will try to find it the tag name as a company name.

And you also have a series like V 0 to V right now we 7 is going on. So you also have having a series of YOLO models. We used YOLO before we fight so we did not get like we got the pretend model.

And also yeah, we also did the annotations because when you are when you are using any when you are training any detection model, so for the images you have to have The annotation of that because your model is going to use the notation the notation was your bounding box bounding box the coordinates and also the bounding box coordinates all and also you name of whatever class of that so we have wanted that txt file for that. So me I use the label MZ to annotate the data and we use that they noted data to the YOLO model and we train the model and also we that model so we're going to integrate in the Android device. So the YOLO was in fights. And mobile device is mostly working. Like it's very feasible to a work on the TF Lite model as compared to dot PT because bites were Fighters gave the model in don't pity format. So the ending wanted the model format or flight. So that was very you can say that was a difficult part to change the YOLO model here to to in to TF Lite, but also providing a script for changing the dot PT model to TF Lite like you can export your model in TF Lite former. You don't need to spot your motor dot PT if you are you whether you are using pythons for that.

But the model will be of too large size and using it on phones or some embedded device would be very difficult, and the latency will be very high. Such hardware support might not be available. So with little decrease in accuracy, we can achieve good, speed and, still have a manageable still have a except sufficient accuracies with that. Like, instead of using more of heavy models with high accuracy, I will try to use some, lightweight models like small version instead of using large version of YOLO. And try to check if the those models are giving sufficient accurate for the production environment.

Given your experience, what potential challenges or constraints do you foresee in implementing this machine learning pipeline for detecting and predicting maintenance issues in solar panels?","Okay. So one major challenge was that, the data capturing process process needs to be focused. Like, when we want to have a good ortho mosaic, it should have a certain degree of overlap. Like, a 40 degree side overlap and oh, sorry, 40% side overlap. And 40% or 50%, those, front overlap. So that was something that is the kind of not, in our control. It's a bit it's on the field team. So that was one of the challenge that we faced. Another was the the drifter problem. So initially, what we had seen was, once we have trained our model and put it into production, the thing was, it it was performing very well on, our training set that we had trained the model on, even on the validation set, which the model had not seen. But once we put it into the production, the new also that were coming in, they had very poor performance. So we wanted to understand what was the reason. So that's why we had implemented that dip drift detection system. So once we see there once we observed that there was significant drift in the training data that we had. And the latest data that we are currently getting, So we were able to pinpoint that where exactly the problem. So the problem was the field team had upgraded their drones for to a newer version, which are kind of better, and, we're able to capture high quality images. But, we were not aware that. And, we had, basically trained our model on the old image set, which was, a different drone than what the 3rd field team was currently loading. So that's when we realized that this was a problem, and so we retrained the model on that part. On the auto and images, from this new set of images by newer newer one. So yeah. So one of the challenges was, that knowing everything about data, how the data was connected. That was one of the crucial thing that I understood and will remember. Hopefully, in future, that, we also need to be aware of data collection process. So this was all one of the main problems, that we had faced. Yeah. So not too much. Rest everything kind of went smooth. And the preprocessing and experimenting with GSD to understand how the, that bounding box effect is affecting by its dimension were affected by GST. That was another thing that, we had to initially faced talent, but then we understood that, yeah, DSD is something that we also need to focus on. So, yeah, that's all I believe.

5,Great! I see from your resume that you've worked on a project involving one-shot learning for medical image analysis. Could you walk me through the approach you took for this project and how you implemented it using TensorFlow?,"Sure, so the current problem that I faced doing that particular time was we had a particular data set of value of just a few hundred of labeled data set for something called chromosome analysis. So we had to build a model for classification regarding that so we couldn't go with the conventional class CNN because the problem is with such less dated always under fits and it's very difficult to generalize and the option that I took was going with contrastive learning. Which turned out to be very well at good and generalizing compared to a CNN based approach. So the approach is very simple. We had around 100 100 to 200 label data. So I built a service network, which is basically two Networks. Of the same network. So what this does is it takes an image as an input and gives you an output as an embedding. And the idea is that you give it pairs of images sometimes even triplet if you using triplet loss. So I used to close in this case. So it took three images One images called anchor image. The other image is an image, which is similar to this anchor image, right? The other image is something that's not so it's not the same classes jacket image. So what it does is it tries to create embeddings such that the distance or The euclidean distance you can say between the embeddings of the ones in the same class is minimized and the embedded distance between the embeddings of the ones and the different class is a maximized. So at the end when you convert an image with a Samus Network into embedding space it tries to minimize the distance between inter-class and Max is a difference between indoor. inter class so this is how much short learning for you used and the main benefit in this particular thing was that we were able to generalize very well, even though we had a very less data set compared to training a deep CNN which was not able to generalize later on when we got more data Weasley shifted to deep sea animals, but with this limited data one shot learning with Sam's networks worked great.",4,True,"['Response 1 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 2 is better']"

And also yeah, we also did the annotations because when you are when you are using any when you are training any detection model, so for the images you have to have The annotation of that because your model is going to use the notation the notation was your bounding box bounding box the coordinates and also the bounding box coordinates all and also you name of whatever class of that so we have wanted that txt file for that. So me I use the label MZ to annotate the data and we use that they noted data to the YOLO model and we train the model and also we that model so we're going to integrate in the Android device. So the YOLO was in fights. And mobile device is mostly working. Like it's very feasible to a work on the TF Lite model as compared to dot PT because bites were Fighters gave the model in don't pity format. So the ending wanted the model format or flight. So that was very you can say that was a difficult part to change the YOLO model here to to in to TF Lite, but also providing a script for changing the dot PT model to TF Lite like you can export your model in TF Lite former. You don't need to spot your motor dot PT if you are you whether you are using pythons for that. So YOLO, so that time we first we did we changed the road PT model into one and x and we use the openvino to change that model into at 5. And after that we change that model into day of light and then we send that model to the Android team. for the testing part",3,True,"['Response 2 is better', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 1 is better']"
3,What potential trade-offs or compromises might you need to make during the implementation of this real-time object detection system?,"So first, I'll I'll work with a very small dummy model for object detection using a same model to debug. That trade off could be, like, if I use very good model version like YOLO v YOLO v 10, big large version, that accuracy will be very high. But the model will be of too large size and using it on phones or some embedded device would be very difficult, and the latency will be very high. Such hardware support might not be available. So with little decrease in accuracy, we can achieve good, speed and, still have a manageable still have a except sufficient accuracies with that. Like, instead of using more of heavy models with high accuracy, I will try to use some, lightweight models like small version instead of using large version of YOLO. And try to check if the those models are giving sufficient accurate for the production environment. And then I'll compromise I will compromise, high accuracy with a slightly low accuracy, but for faster speed.",4,True,"['Response 1 is better', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 2 is better']"
4,"That sounds like a solid high-level approach. Let's delve a bit deeper into some aspects of your solution. Given your experience, what potential challenges or constraints do you foresee in implementing this machine learning pipeline for detecting and predicting maintenance issues in solar panels?","Okay. So one major challenge was that, the data capturing process process needs to be focused. Like, when we want to have a good ortho mosaic, it should have a certain degree of overlap. Like, a 40 degree side overlap and oh, sorry, 40% side overlap. And 40% or 50%, those, front overlap. So that was something that is the kind of not, in our control. It's a bit it's on the field team. So that was one of the challenge that we faced. Another was the the drifter problem. So initially, what we had seen was, once we have trained our model and put it into production, the thing was, it it was performing very well on, our training set that we had trained the model on, even on the validation set, which the model had not seen. But once we put it into the production, the new also that were coming in, they had very poor performance. So we wanted to understand what was the reason. So that's why we had implemented that dip drift detection system. So once we see there once we observed that there was significant drift in the training data that we had. And the latest data that we are currently getting, So we were able to pinpoint that where exactly the problem. So the problem was the field team had upgraded their drones for to a newer version, which are kind of better, and, we're able to capture high quality images. But, we were not aware that. And, we had, basically trained our model on the old image set, which was, a different drone than what the 3rd field team was currently loading. So that's when we realized that this was a problem, and so we retrained the model on that part. On the auto and images, from this new set of images by newer newer one. So yeah. So one of the challenges was, that knowing everything about data, how the data was connected. That was one of the crucial thing that I understood and will remember. Hopefully, in future, that, we also need to be aware of data collection process. So this was all one of the main problems, that we had faced. Yeah. So not too much. Rest everything kind of went smooth. And the preprocessing and experimenting with GSD to understand how the, that bounding box effect is affecting by its dimension were affected by GST. That was another thing that, we had to initially faced talent, but then we understood that, yeah, DSD is something that we also need to focus on. So, yeah, that's all I believe. Those are the challenges that face. That's it.",3,True,"['Response 1 is better', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 1 is better', 'Response 2 is better']"
5,Great! I see from your resume that you've worked on a project involving one-shot learning for medical image analysis. Could you walk me through the approach you took for this project and how you implemented it using TensorFlow?,"Sure, so the current problem that I faced doing that particular time was we had a particular data set of value of just a few hundred of labeled data set for something called chromosome analysis. So we had to build a model for classification regarding that so we couldn't go with the conventional class CNN because the problem is with such less dated always under fits and it's very difficult to generalize and the option that I took was going with contrastive learning. Which turned out to be very well at good and generalizing compared to a CNN based approach. So the approach is very simple. We had around 100 100 to 200 label data. So I built a service network, which is basically two Networks. Of the same network. So what this does is it takes an image as an input and gives you an output as an embedding. And the idea is that you give it pairs of images sometimes even triplet if you using triplet loss. So I used to close in this case. So it took three images One images called anchor image. The other image is an image, which is similar to this anchor image, right? The other image is something that's not so it's not the same classes jacket image. So what it does is it tries to create embeddings such that the distance or The euclidean distance you can say between the embeddings of the ones in the same class is minimized and the embedded distance between the embeddings of the ones and the different class is a maximized. So at the end when you convert an image with a Samus Network into embedding space it tries to minimize the distance between inter-class and Max is a difference between indoor. inter class so this is how much short learning for you used and the main benefit in this particular thing was that we were able to generalize very well, even though we had a very less data set compared to training a deep CNN which was not able to generalize later on when we got more data Weasley shifted to deep sea animals, but with this limited data one shot learning with Sam's networks worked great.",4,True,"['Response 2 is better', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 2 is better', 'Response 2 is better']"
